The third course was vegetables and falafels, very tasty but not too sweet! The fourth course was dessert & we all had the same dessert - it was yummy!

It was a soggy ass mess...then Meat Pizza and Bolognese Pasta...no options on Pizza  and they served the veal bolognese( I had high hopes, I know..but I did)...with pre bought corkscrew noodles to an adult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only corkscrew I like is in my wine.,Seriously ,VEAL ON CORKSCREW...am I missing something? Apparently..I will never miss this place another second of one moment of one ioda of one day in my life..Sorry tangit...so then, apparently the wait staff had not seen each other since high school...because they concregated more on \"catch up\"than actually waiting tables...when she finally did come over she stacked our dishes and left them there, then took 15 min to get the check back....15!!!! THEY WEREN'T EVEN BUSY! So, then on the way out  the\"not old enough to lick a postage stamp hostess\" is actually chewing her nails as we are leaving and does not EVEN bother to take her fingers out of her mouth as she says...\"thanks for coming\" ..really? really right now? no one has said that with less enthusiasum than when my best gay friend and I decided to have sex just to see what it woudl be like...If you have a perfectly ironed golf shirt and like Tomaso's  and have a case of Scotch in your trunk and have to take your wife to dinner, drop her drunk ass off at home, then get your plasta gal on speed dial then this place is for you.

Also,  traditional wings are more restrictive and more expensive than boneless, which in my experience is backwards.  It is also insanely loud in the place.  On top of it they charge almost $5 for the weakest, wilted little side salad.  Also, they bring 10 wings in a small order, plus carrots and celery, with an Itty bitty 2 oz. Of ranch.

      "First thing to know about Melt is there is almost ALWAYS a wait. I went with two friends on a Saturday at 4:00PM and the wait was 30-40 minutes. My friends said they have arrived when it opens at 11:00AM and there is still a line waiting to get in. So, if you are in a hurry, go elsewhere. And, obviously, the smaller the group the easier to be seated. Tables are basically 4-square so larger groups can have a few pulled together. But waiting for some to open up near each other might take a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the staff is very friendly. While standing at the hostess desk they saw I was wearing a \"Praise Cheeses\" T-shirt that they loved (I mean, their name IS Melt.). When seated, one of them even came by and leaned in to the waiter to say \"Check out his shirt!\" The waiter took the time to explain, as it was my first visit there, that I could have virtually anything I wanted and they would prepare it anyway I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandwiches are massive. I ordered their burger, a half pound of fresh beef, at $11.00. Prices, on the surface, seem high. I ordered my burger with blackened seasoning. For another buck I added grilled onions, and for another buck-and-a-half, avocado. That might seem high: $13.50 for a burger. But that included a huge amount of fries (some of which I had to take home). And when considering other high-end burger joints like B-Spot, The Rail or Flip Side, prices are actually right in line. I just hoped the food matched the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how was it? The burger arrived already cut in half with a ton of fries and a pickle. No bun. Toasted, thick-cut bread held the burger. The waiter had explained they don't really use a grill, so the blackened seasoning wouldn't be seared into the meat. It came cooked medium-well, but still juicy. I took a bite and decided it was pretty good. Then I experienced something unusual: with every bite the burger tasted better and better. The seasoning became more noticeable.Toppings (avocado) were falling off, which I used my fork to finish, and the bread/bun held up enough that I could finish the entire. Yes. It went from a pretty good burger to a great burger, and all I had to do was keep eating it!\n",

      "When one thinks of Huntersville, NC it does not exactly feel as the abode of an authentic family owned Italian restaurant serving up one of the best tasting marinara ever! This place is super busy on weekends and since they don't take reservations it is always hard to go here in large groups. However, the staff is super friendly and will happily serve up beers and wine with a fun filled conversation in the lobby while you wait. The wait is worth it. The Mozzarella in Carrozza comes drenched in their all so yummy marinara. This is a dreamy concoction that can be best described as just loads of flavor in each bite where the fresh mozzarella blends with the crunchy texture of the bread and the tangy marinara that has the natural sweetness of vine ripened tomatoes. You will want to get that plate clean with the fresh bread they have at the table which is a nice good hearty crusted loaf with a tender white inside. My personal favorite is the Pollo Parmigiana with substituting the angel hair pasta for fettuccine Alfredo. They put on a big smile to accommodate changes. If you are in for a sweet tooth, then their cannoli's are authentic and fresh, and they are Italian sized. None of that wannabe dessert size here. The penne ala vodka is equally delectable, the sauce is simply unique and if you are a vodka sauce fan then theirs is definitely very zesty and flavorful. Love this place and the folks who run it. Always smiling and always cheerful.

BBQ Pork banh mi had a decent amount of meat, good flavor, and I'd say was the best of the three.  The grilled chicken & grilled steak ones had minimal amount of meat.  All three were very skimpy on the pickled vegetables, which is one of the distinctive flavors I like about banh mi.  They did use a good glop of mayo on all three sandwiches, which I am not really used to, but not super opposed to.  I'd give them another try, but not on any of the banh mi.  I hope their pho is better...\n",
