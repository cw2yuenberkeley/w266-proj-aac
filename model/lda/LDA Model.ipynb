      "Review text:  Stayed at the California Hotel 4th of July weekend. Had read about 777 and decided to try it since the west tower where I was staying at the California is about a 3 minute walk away. I enjoyed the bar so much that I ate every meal during my stay there. Yeah, sounds lame but I don't give a shit, the place was nice and it was too damn hot to be strolling around. The microbrews were about a 3/5. The two I was looking forward to were out but oh well. They had a pale ale called Marker that I settled in on. While in vegas I only eat during happy hour(s) which is 3p-6p and  after midnight. The beers are $2 during HH. The food was 4.5/5..I had (not all at once) wings, nacho supreme, meatlovers flatbread pizza, broiled chicken sandwhich and a pepper crusted ribeye (medium). Man, that damn ribeye was delicious, came with a baked potato and greens for $15.99. When I stayed on the strip last year with friends, I payed $50 for a Ribeye at some place in Ceasars that couldn't touch this one. All in all this place was real chill, the bartenders were by in large real cool, some came off strange ( and stressed) but that's common, and I never had a problem getting a bar stool during HH. I think California Hotel and 777 will be my new set when in vegas solo for fights.\n",

      "Had a special of the day: ravioli with grilled chicken. Very good red sauce and ravioli, chicken was kind of eh. It came with a thick piece of toasted Italian bread that was perfect with the meal.\n",
      "Stopped by with a friend who had been  to IPH and wanted to go back. Very casual atmosphere with a big bar, long list of beers and many TV's.  \n",
      "Ordered a fall special of Smoke & Fire that is a smoked brisket with a pepper cheese (forgot the name) and an onion ring with hand cut fries.  The brisket comes on a bun that is large and very good.  It definitely had some of the smoke flavor and some spiciness from the cheese.  We definitely enjoyed our food.  The Smoke & Fire \"Handheld\" sandwich cost $16.  Thought it to be good but the price seems to be a bit high, guess you are paying for the ambiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Yea, the WIFI sucks.  Did not work for us.\n",
      "Nice new restaurant.  Friendly service.  Now for the food...really tasty with a crisp crust and with spicy sopressata and Mike's Hot honey, nice combo of flavors. Stop by and try some of the creative pizza's with fresh ingredients, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Nice place.  Like the remodel/environment.  Sat at a booth to do some work and have lunch.  There were a few others working on there computers, too.  \n",
      "The tables are all on very old/antique sewing machine stands. the booths seats are a little higher then a normal chair but comfy.  The table was about the height of a computer table so easy to type but I did find myself leaning forward for some reason.  Guess I like a harder backed chair to type when using my computer.  \n",
      "Ordered a Banh Mi that was marinated pork that was cut into small strips with fresh cilanto.  Added the sriracha to add some more taste.  On a fresh baguette.  A very good Banh Mi.  Had a Bubble tea that was good.  You can pick some flavors to add if you wish.    \n",
      "there was some nice softer music playing in the background.\n",
      "To have a slice or a cone.  If you want a cone, go to Pizza Cono.  Fun to have a  pizza cono and walk down the street munching away.  If you like to fold your pizza slices, this is a different version for you.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting to watch the cones put into a  carousel oven to cook the pizza cone.  It seems that the cones go thru the oven a couple of times. \n",

      "\n",
      "The pizza cone tasted good but was not warm all the way thru.  They have operation issues as well.  A few families in the three booths.  One eating, the others waiting.  As the pizza conos being cooked were taken off the carousel the staff was unsure what cono was,  what was it done, which order was it.  Some conos were brought out but they did not have the order #, just did you order this type of cono?  With about 10 conos on carousel, they need to somehow ID the cones on the carousel to the order.  Finally, they seemed to figure it out.  Wait time.  Over 40 minutes due to the confusion.  We were offered a free drink for our wait and their confusion. \n",

      "Interesting concept.  Nice taste.  Probably a little more expensive than a big slice at a different shop but where else can you meander down the street with a pizza cono!\n",
      "Take N' Bake your own pizza.  Second location for this new concept.  You order the style of pizza you want.  Take it home and follow the baking instructions and there you have it.  Hot and fresh pizza.  They say it is all natural, fresh and homemade.  The pizza is put in a plastic wrap with parchment paper under it.  You cook it on the parchment paper, take it out of the oven, let it cool a few minutes and then it is time to eat. The menu includes some fresh salads and some sweets including cookies that you bake.\n",
      "\n",
      "This take N' bake concept can be OK in some cases, but I usually want my Pizza cooked so I can eat it now.  But I have had some take N' bake from another pizza place and cooked for a party.  \n",

      "Had a Signature Pie, The Artisan, that has spinach, crumbed feta, Sun-Dried tomato and more.   The crust was good and brown and not to thick.  All in all an interesting concept that would seem to be more for those that do not want to eat it now or have a little later when some friends drop by.\n",
      "Stopped in to get a pizza to split for lunch.  Ordered the small pizza with some toppings for take out.  The menu had a tossed round pizza on top, so I thought that was what we ordered.  We received 6 pieces of the Sicilian Square pizza, so a little surprise.  The pizza was pretty standard square pizza with a good sauce, cheese and toppings.\n",
      "Very good food and wait staff and not your usual Italian lunch menu. Lou the owner does a great job with the menu and food quality.  Waitress was very nice, very efficient, friendly and full of energy and smiles -- in Pittsburgh to go to school.  Buon Giorno is a place I meet friends every so often for a good lunch and sometimes a friend brings a bottle of wine since it is BYOB, very nice!  They have fresh baked bread and olive oil and balsamic on the table to start.  Have specials every day and some pasta's and focaccia sandwiches, grilled vegetables and good salads.  Had the Italian Tuna sandwich with comes with artichokes, mozzarella and more.  Sandwich comes with a small salad on the same plate.  Have had the Red Roasted Pepper sandwich and pastas in past visits, all very good.  Deserts are good and made at the restaurant.\n",
      "Stopped by for a late lunch.  Decided to try a Q-Ritos, which is Yinzburgh version of South of the border meets BBQ.  I had rice with black eyed peas and pulled pork on a flour tortilla.  Found the Q to be very good with great flavors.  The meat had a nice smoke BBQ pork taste.  A good quick meal!\n",
      "\"Pizza Well Done\" is the motto.  Yes it is.  Our pizza crust was burnt. It you like to taste coal and burnt char the crust may suffice.  The pizza was pretty good.  Only one piece had a burnt bottom.  But I prefer my pizza not burnt on the crust.  So will probably look for some of my other fave places in the future.\n",

      "Disappointing!  After many times of trying to stop and always finding El Milagro closed when the hours say it should be open, see other review, stopped by on Friday night during dinner hour. Thought it may be crowded but was looking to take out.  Walked in and no one was in the restaurant.  Eh Oh!  Ordered two carnitas tacos that come with fresh onion, radish and cilantro.  Looking good.  Took my first bite and hit something hard, very hard. Thought I was biting into some wood.  Some very overcooked and to hard to chew meat.  Took it out.  Took a second bite, same process, could not chew the hard meat.  So I picked thru the taco, took about half the meat out and then was able to eat it.  The meat was not very good, the taco was not very good.  Also ordered the Tampiquena that is steak, shrimp, peppers, tomatoes and onions in a marinade that comes with rice and beans.  The shrimp was cooked correctly but the steak was overcooked and very tough and hard to chew.  \n",

Only one tamale left so decided to have a taco with it.  Tacos are good too.  The menu is limited but some good Mexican food at a good price.  The server mentioned that La Palapa uses Clarion foods beef for the beef tacos.\n",

Mineo's seems to put more cheese on then many pizza places and usually I don't want a lot of cheese but it works at Mineo's.  Sometimes the cheese seems to get a little greasy looking but not today, and it is always good.   The pepperoni slices are thicker and very tasty.  \n",

Pretty good Queso, chips, burritos.  Have learned that I am not a big fan of Moe's carnitas, the seasoning seems to be a little off to me, so I order one of the other options.  There is usually one person cleaning tables and helping out in the seating area, which is good so it is kept relatively clean.\n",

The bartender is great, friendly and mixes a good drink.  We split the Lamb Empanada with mole sauce, lime cilantro slaw and the Pear and Roasted Beet salad; both were very good.  For the main course, I had the Red Wine Raised Beef Short Ribs that had an apple cider glaze with some delicious whipped potatoes and baby carrots.  The meal was delicious, meat was tender and tasty.  \n",

      "We started with wine since that is suppose to be one of the draws of E&H. There are 10 house wines, 7 sparking wines by the glass or bottle.  Then there are the climate controlled red (8), whites (7) and bottles (6).  The 8 red and 7 white climate controled are offered in 1oz, 3oz, 6oz, or bottle.  Decided to try a couple of wines but found the prices way high, way high.  You can get a 6oz pour of the TB Primitivo for more than a bottle price at the state store (some of the others wines they have available are similar in pricing).  There is a happy hour pricing that lowers the 6oz pour but none of the others pours are lower.  We learned that on Wednesday you can get a pizza and house bottle for $30, so maybe go on a Wednesday.  While I enjoyed the wines I tried I found they tend to have wines that are more on the very fruity and plum side and with not as much balance and tannin.  One wine I had was the Mollydooker Merlot and it was enjoyable but a tad fruity to go with the pizza I had.  \n",
      "The food was very good.  We started with the Beets & Bleu salad that was very good.  It has grilled golden beets with lots of greens, candied pecans and a nice viaigrette.   Our pizza choice was the Chicken Spinach Artichoke pizza that had mozzarella, pesto cream and a touch of smoked chili.  Our meal was very enjoyable.\n",
      "Service was friendly but they were overwhelmed.  Not sure why they seemed to be understaffed.  The waitstaff was working hard but had to many tables to cover.  Think they only had two waitresses and the all the tables were full. The kitchen staff helped out bringing out the food.  We did ask for some different wines for our second glass and it took a really long time to get our second glass, as well as our first glass.  Also, we were asked if we would like some parmesan and pepper flakes for our pizza, which we accepted and they never came.\n",

      "If you are looking for an enjoyable meal with food made from scratch with fresh products, this is the place.  The menu has breakfast (I think served until 11am), salads, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Prosciutto sandwich that had fresh mozzarella, pesto, olive tapenade, roasted peppers on home baked ciabatta.  Delicious!  The meat and cheese were so good and the olive tapenade and roasted peppers added a wonderful flavor.  The sandwich came with a pickle wedge and some potato chips.  For some reason, this potato chip hound was not a fan of the potato chips.  Not sure of the brand or if in house but think they were bought not make in house.  \n",

I had the special of Prime Rib, delicious, cooked perfectly.  For dessert we shared a couple of wonderful treats including a chocolate cake, unfortunately do not remember the name.  Others with us all enjoyed their dinner.  Service was very good too.\n",
      "A great food truck.  Very friendly service and fresh ingredients.  The chicken banh mi was one of the better banh mi I have ever tasted.  Tasty chicken with a nice sauce that I could not really identify, but oh so good.  The sandwich had pickled cucumbers and carrots, and cilantro.   \n",

The restaurant is nice and in a newer little strip mall.  The place was jumping.  The baby back ribs were good, with some smoke flavor, not overcooked, and tender.  The ribs were completed on a grill with the sauce.  The sauce was OK, but not great.   The ribs were not over sauced, like many places.   For sides the sweet potato fries were rather ordinary.  The baked beans were tasty, sweet (must have a little brown sugar in the recipe) and had some pulled pork to add some flavor.   \n",

While many places have PO Boy sandwiches most are pretty non-discript & do not have much flavor, not so the Pittsburgh PO Boy.

Well the pizza crust was toasted very crisp on the bottom but was like toasted bread with many airy holes like bread with pizza sauce and cheese on top.  The sauce and cheese were good but the crust just didn't make it for my tastes.    Guess I should have tried the small pizza and had leftovers.\n",

You get as many toppings as you want for $8.  My pizza crust was overcooked, to hard and very crunchy and had no real taste.  Some of the topping were a little burnt, not the way I prefer.  The do have a couple of salad choices to. This location has limited seating at some high tables.  V3 is owned by the owner of Vocelli's Pizza.\n",

      "Stopped in to this new Walnut Grill, formerly Stone Pepper location.  Have enjoyed some happy hours drinks and appetizers at some other WG's but we stopped in for a meal.  My Blackened Salmon BLT was OK, the bacon was tasty but the fish was not real good or fresh.  The sweet potato fries were large slices of potato and OK.  We sat in the bar area and it was busy and looks like it will be a typical WG.  There are about 30 beers on tap.\n",
      "Back in the old hood and stopped in to catch the hockey game and some grub.  Our waitress was good, being there when refills were needed.  The wait staff wear referee outfits, so it definitely has the sports bar theme.  Since Timeout seems to promote the barbeque, ordered the brisket sandwich that is cooked over cherry wood.  The brisket was good with a nice smoke flavor but the sauce that came with it was somewhat sharp and sour, so not my flavorite (favorite).  The pizza looked good but none or us ordered it (the group next to us had it and seemed to enjoy it).\n",
      "Stopped by cause the college age kids wanted a quick breakfast burrito.  The place looks relatively new and was clean.  The staff was friendly.  Having not been to a TB for years so was not sure what to expect.  They have a breakfast burrito for $1 that the kids like because it taste OK and is cheap. I decided to join in and found it to be OK but the tortilla was a little over cooked for my tasted.  Not sure how they heat it up but it was very brown on most of the shell, similar to being heated in a pan but for way to long.\n",
      "Stopped in for breakfast.  The place is a little worn and needed some light bulbs replaced; someone did leave to get some bulbs when we were there.   The menu has some interesting items on it.  I was rather plain and just had a breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese on a bun.  The sausage was good, a good sign since most diners have sub-par sausage.  The home fires were not very good.  \n",

      "Fresh bread came out immediately and was welcome by my stomach since I as famished. My salad was good with an assortment of greens, with tomato and cucumber.  My crab cake was just OK.\n",
      "This is your local diner.  Reasonable prices with good food and friendly service.  Had the No. 2, which is two eggs with bacon and a large pancake.  It arrive with sausage instead of bacon and I decided to have the sausage since it looked good, and it was!  My eggs, pancakes and sausage were $5.  Now that is a good meal at a good price.  Better than the diner around the corner in my opinion.\n",
      "Nice and new.  Never been to a Jersey Mike's, so we stopped after a round of golf because we only had time for a quick lunch.  Service was fast.  Meat and cheese was cut for your order.  The bread was ok and you get more meat than most other subs places.  Had the Italian sub, which was good, but I prefer my Italian to be cooked.\n",
      "It was one of those rainy cold nights and was looking for some comfort food.  Found it a Piacq.  A bar in the front so the dinning room is not real large and seemed a little dark, Ok maybe ambiance, nah, maybe it was just a cold rainy night.

Heard the other waitress and she asked about drinks, told that table about the fresh soups of the day.  Oh Dear!!!!to have the better waitress would have been nice; but actually we were fine.  Waitress was prompt in bringing out some fresh italian bread with dipping oil with sun dried tomato's, it was so delicious, could have just eaten the bread with the dipping oil.  Food came out relatively fast and was hot.\n",

      "Really nice interior, has the old school tavern feel.  There are about 4 outdoor stools that connect to the inside but a little to cold these days to try those, anyway seats with backs are more comfy.  I liked the fact that you can get a half or whole sandwich.  A half is pretty large and we were having a late lunch so did not want to over eat that this time.  A good place for a good sandwich on Breadworks bread and slow roasted cooking.  The Italian Roasted pork is a house made Porchetta, with Provolone and Braised Rapini served with some au jus.  While the sandwich was different than some of the Italian Pork sandwiches I have had in Chicago and locally, it was very good with some sweetness and a little spice flavor.  Definitely a good place for a sandwich and a beer or cocktail.\n",
      "The service was fast and super friendly, too.\n",
      "Salvation! and why am I drooling?  That Danny's Italian Hoagie I had for lunch is so divine.  There are imitators but none compare!

      "Yahoo, great service and top notch Banh Mi.  On this visit had the Xa Xiu which is a roasted pork belly with char ixu base and fish base that comes with fresh toppings and you can get sriracha. \n",
      "As everyone has said, the service is super friendly and willing to explain anything they serve before you order.  It was crowded with not seats when we were there today so we got it to go.  Even though it was crowded our sandwiches came out relatively fast.  If you are looking for a good authentic Viet sandwich, or spring rolls or rice bowls this is your place.\n",
      "We used the online app to set up a reservation and were seated almost immediately.  The menu's were so sticky and gross.  Come on, clean your menu's and give us clean menu!\n",
      "While we were waiting we were surrounded by little moth like bugs.  Not sure what the deal is but not good.  My steak was a little tough and a tad overcooked but OK.  My baked potato came in some foil and was OK but overly steamed from being in the foil to long.\n",

      "Enjoyable.  The atmosphere is a little different with some couches and a sitting area to go along with tables.  Entrance is thru a black door not the glass door. Two areas once inside.  A few tables in the entrance area and the larger area with the couches and some more tables.\n",

      "Had the Bamia which is okra with a tomato sauce and Egyptian spices.  A side salad with a nice oil dressing came with the meal.   Service was very friendly but somewhat disjointed.\n",
      "Have been to GV's a few times in the last year...thought I had reviewed...but none appear.  So here we go: Stopped in with a group from work that ventures here more often than I.  Service is good and friendly.  Refills came without asking.  Our meals came out in good time.  On my prior visit I had the Crab Sliders that were tasty and pretty good, not to much filler and came with some (I think homemade) chips that needed a little salt (my preference) and is a favorite of another in our group.  I remember having the Buffalo Chicken Wrap on a prior visit and really enjoyed it.  This visit I had a Stromboli where I selected a couple of my favorite items to be enclosed.  It was perfectly cooked and perfect for a somewhat chilly evening.  Should probably have a pizza since they have a brick oven, next time.  Someone had a salad and it was huge and looked to be fresh and left with enough for a second meal. \n",

      "One of my favorite places.  Wine selections was good. Place was very crowded but managed to get a table.  Service was very good and friendly.  Started with some ceviche and some robata grill and since during happy hour discounted.  Had Bacon-wrapped quill eggs are a good starter come with three sauces.  Had some others including duck quesadilla, lamb lollipops and beef tenderloin.  The chef is very creative and is able to pull it off.   It is a blend of Latin and Asian.\n",
      "Interesting to read some of the other reviews.  Stopped to try the bread on a recommendation, thinking it would go well with a meal we were going to have.  The bread is very good.   We were able to sample and took a half loaf home with us.  As others have said, they weigh the bread and then you pay by the oz.  Yes it is more expensive then many places but nice for a change of pace.  When we want some special homemade bread we tend to get our bread at a little local bread and pizza shop near us and the B&S bread was just as good but a bit more expensive.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Good food and friendly service.\n",
      "Yum.  Nice casual Mexican....small taco stand type place.  A large menu, ordered a carnitas burrito, which was big like you would expect.  You get pickled carrots and jalapeno peppers with your order, which is popular at many taco stands.  Wish the guacamole on the burrito was bit as thin and soupy, seems to be mixed with a watery sour cream so it is a little thin and soupy.  \n",

      "Great to have a good Taco shop to stop and enjoy.   If you like Mexican food, you will enjoy CTS.\n",
      "Coach's is your typical sports bar.  Lots of big screen TV's, very open area in stark black and white walls.  Just your typical sports bar menu with reasonable prices.  About ten beers on draft, looked like about the same number of beers by the bottle.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries were good.   \n",

      "Another good pizza shop in the McMurray area.  Stop by say hello to Albino.  Read his Italian newspaper as you wait for your order.  The shop has about 10 tables but the parking lot has less spaces so if it gets crowded you may have to use the fast food lot next door.\n",

      "Stopped in a Friday to have some seafood and the meal was great.  Everything on the menu seems to be tasty and well thought out and prepared.  The Mediterranean Bronzini on a parmesan polenta was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  Of course SWMBO ordered the crispy Green Beans to start, that are so much fun to eat.  \n",
      "As always, the service was good.\n",
      "Had a great family meal.  Nice part is that you can order breakfast at dinner time.   In our group we had breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We were farthest table from kitchen which is not always good but service was very good.  Food was good, had the Buffalo chicken salad and it was tasty and fresh lettuce and tomatoes.  It was nice that we actually had some time to sit and talk between ordering and had a good time.  \n",

      "If you want fast food, you can call ahead and order and pick up at the drive in window.  What  good idea!\n",
      "Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all, \"tastes like dishwater\", was the quote.  Naw, that couldn't happen to homemade gnocchi, after a taste, I agreed!  Just goes to show, it depends on what you order.\n",

      "Oh yea, the parking lot, very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit.\n",
      "Well, finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK, cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well, we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well, the outer crust was crisp, chicken was hard..hard to chew, tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable.\n",
      "The food and service were excellent.  The atmosphere is on the romantic side. What not to like? The prices are good too.  Eat here for the same amount as an oyster bar and fancy pizza place last week.  The bar has a happy hour with $1 off some small apps (Bocas menu and beer on tap) that are available at the bar.  The Mozzarella with egg plant copanata was a great start.  For the main course ordered the Pheasant with rosemary, grilled homemade gnocchi and brussels sprouts that was perfectly cooked and outstanding.  \n",

      "Enjoyable Greek Mediterranean food and BYOB.  Gyros, baklava, feta cheese, Greek style pizza in a brick oven.   The tables are rather close and it did get a little noisy.  Had lamb that was very good.  A nice place to BYOB and relax and have an enjoyable meal!\n",
      "As many have said, good Fro-Yo and organic options.  Service is helpful and friendly.  Can't believe I have not posted a review before this.  Anyway, great flavors.  Self serve.  \n",

      "A simple menu of pizza, salads, chicken wings and a couple of sandwiches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the coal-fired chicken wings which come out crisp with caramelized onions.   The onions were gooood but the wings were lacking flavor except for a little char flavor and a little salty tasting. The pizza was good with a burnt taste which gave it a subtle flavor of charcoal...not overly burnt.  The crust is thin as you would expect for a fired oven pizza.  Had Italian sausage as a topping and it was kind of sweet..was hoping for a spicier flavor.\n",

      "Ordered the Buffalo Dog with onions, pepper rings, Buffalo Sauce and Jalapenos.  A typical dog with good condiments.  Had the fries with which looked to be fresh cut and were tasty.  Prices are low, so if you want a dog or to create your own donut this is a nice quick stop.\n",
      "Another welcome addition to the restaurant scene in the Burgh.  Cool place.  Nice to have some Spanish cuisine.  There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so. \n",
      "We stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,\n",
      "Fun place to have a meal on the porch.  Stopped by for lunch and the weather was perfect for eating on the porch.  Fun to watch the people pass by.  Kids on scooters, ladies rushing to parking meters from the hair palour next door to put money in the meter with the smocks still on and hair in all kinds of conditions...lol.   Nice little menu of Soups, sandwiches, salads, wraps.\n",

      "Ordered the Salmon (encrusted with dijon mustard0 salad special of the day.  Was informed it was the last one and I did not go late.  Salad had fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, carrot and came with 2 slices of a nicely toasted bread.  The salmon was over powered by the mustard due to the large amount put on top, so I took some off.  Unfortunately, the salmon was under cooked.  Had a similar salmon salad at a restauant a few doors down recently that was better and less expensive, and that restaurant is much fancier.\n",

      "Note:  OPEN Monday thru Friday 11 to 9.\n",

We were able to get a description of a few items we were interested in, Our food came out at a good pace and we were asked if we wanted additional drinks and how we liked the food.  One gentleman stopped by to make sure we were happy with our meal.  I started with a Jar of goat cheese, balsamic-eggplant, toast - very tasty and good especially the goat cheese, thought the eggplant was there but did not add anything to the jar. Then I had the duck breast & confit, foie gras, tortellini, roots.  This was a huge success.  A tasty and nice balance of flavors.  All in a a good place to relax and have a good meal.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chose a Creamy Corn/Poblano soup that was delicious.  Thick with nice flavors, still green poblano so not hot, just a nice flavoring.  The chips were good and the mild salsa was really tasty but spicier than expected for a mild.   The pork taco was good with a tasty corn tortilla.  The pork was not very flavorful and probably a little overcooked, but the toppings and salsa were very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is small and very casual.  Would expect a bigger crowd especially on weekends, once the Southside crew learn about Silvi's.\n",
      "Nice little taco stand with $3 tacos.\n",
      "A friend recommended and said there is another in Greensburg.\n",
      "Ordered 2 tacos.  The Pork that pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro that was suppose to be on a corn tortilla but was on a flour tortilla.  A lime come with the taco.  The taco was good and the meat tasty but it probably had a little to much sauce making it very sloppy and taking away some the the taste of the meat.  The spicy beef taco comes on a flour tortilla with pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, jalapeños, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro.  Enjoyed the taste but again probably a tad to much sauce.  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. Servers can be slow or fast.  Server was rushing everything, must have been in a hurry to leave.  Also, he had a hard time understanding everyone.  In the past, servers were good but usually slow and if you wanted a drink refill, forget about it for about 20 minutes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Food can be real good or oh so average.  In the past was surprised how good it was.  This time, shrimp overcooked and did not seem fresh, how long was it in the freezer?\n",

      "5. Steak, better hope everyone wants it cooked the same method, especially since they slice it up, usually get it med well since that is the way someone orders it even though asked for medium rare.\n",

      "We still had fun.  But why are they so inconsistent.  Visit before this one was much better.\n",
      "Big bag of home cut fries were tasty!.  Mac & Cheese has little tomato chunks in it, the same way I make it, love it with tomatoes in it!!!..Nice touch!  The ribs were nicely smoked, ordered the hot BBQ sauce but got the middle and it was OK but not what we wanted.\n",

      "No time for desserts but the dessert case was full of homemade deserts.  Was talking with the staff and they said the deserts are made at the HQ baking location near Cleveland and trucked in a couple of times a week.  A family run business with the brother of the owner/creator running this and, I think, all the local locations.\n",
      "Returned to the scene of the crime...Oh Yeah...Guess not!  They moved.  Thought LC would have a little bigger place.  Guess not!  Not Really!  Went late for LC since they close at 8, went about 7:15... all tables were full but you order at the counter, they give you a number and wait for a table.  Was able to get a table before the food arrived, which actually took about 15 minutes.  Very noisy.\n",

The potato and cheddar perogies with cabbage were very good.  We were told the perogies are from an Ohio supplier.\n",

If you come in before eight the waitstaff is not there yet, just Chef Len.  Always get some fresh fruit with my order.  On my last visit had the Eggs Benedict which were perfect.  The waitress did apologize for them taking so long but I did not come in for a fast food meal and know it takes a while because a couple of people ordered just before me.\n",

The staff is friendly.  We got a half rack of ribs.  The ribs were tender, smokey and covered in sauce.  Probably a tad to much sauce.  Not a big fan of the sauce seems to be a lot of pepper and not much else.\n",
      "Stopped in for dinner and it was not very crowded probably due to location and a night early in the week.  Service was good.  We received some chips and salsa.  Really enjoyed.  The salsa had a little heat to it.  The chips appeared to be home made.  Ordered the Enchiladas Verdez that is 3 Green Sauce Chicken enchiladas with rice, lettuce, tomato, gauc and sour cream.  The green sauce was tasty but the chicken really lacked much flavor.\n",
      "This place is classic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally a warm day to take a ride with the top down.  (wasn't Thursday nice after the long winter?)  So I want to Sonic for Happy Hour.   Yes, Sonic has Happy Hour were drinks are 1/2 off.  lol\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, had to decide should I dine on the Patio or in the car?  Patio? Car? Patio? Car?  Finally chose the car.  But Sonic has a patio with umbrella tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the Chicago dog that came on a warm poppy seed bun..must have been in a steamer and was fresh.  The dog can with a couple of whole sport peppers, celery salt and the usual Chicago Dog stuff...very enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who needs Poutine when you can go to Sonic and get Tots (tater tots) with cheese or with cheese and chili sauce?!?!  Chili sauce was so so, as were the Tots.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You can get milk shakes with real ice cream or soda's.  Decided on the root beer float...Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Car hop was real nice.  The manager walked around twice to make sure your order had been taken and to see if you needed anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year stopped by and they had a couple of car hops on roller skates.  Car hop today said that a couple car hops still do skate but not working today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fun place to try and have a good burger, dog, milk shake, float.  \n",
      "\n",
      "May want to go elsewhere for Poutine!\n",
      "Second visit.  The menu was a little different, a few changes I think, looks like a couple items have been taken off the menu.  Heard our waitress say to the people next to us that they have not had an official grand opening because they want to get everyone trained and work out any opening issues.  \n",
      "Anyway, I thought the pizza was good.  It is a 10 inch pizza with homemade sauce that is not sweet with a nice tomato taste and mozzarella cheese.  \n",
      "Anyway, looks like this will be a nice comfy place.  There are a couple of coaches behind the bar and you can sit and relax and hang out.\n",
      "Come join the Society!  \n",
      "Really delicious sandwiches.  \n",
      "If you have the opportunity to give it a try, take it!  \n",
      "Reasonably price, too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Grilled Chicken Club has a marinated chicken that is tasty full of flavor that is topped with bacon, spicy avocado with some mixed greens, tomato and some potato chips.\n",
      "This is take out.  But so good!  Stop and get a great sandwich, shawarma...some good mediterranean food at a reasonable price.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maxime has not changed and very hospitable and will tell you the menu and give you time to decide.  This visit had the Kafta sandwich with was very tasty.  \n",
      "If you are in the area and looking for a good lunch, this is a must stop.\n",
      "How do you celebrate Chinese New Year.  We get together with a group of friends and go out to a good restaurant with Chinese cuisine along with other cuisines.  Stopped in to Angkor and found a group of about 24 in a long table down the middle of the restaurant doing the same.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our group split a couple of apps.  The Crispy Tofu Triangles that comes with a gingery soy sauce and grilled chicken skewer.  Both good but enjoyed the flavorful chicken more.   For the main course I had the Green Curry Noodles; nicely seasoned and spiced.   Plenty to take home for another meal.   Was able to taste some of the BAn Chhev; very good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good. \n",
      "\n",
      "BYOB.  If you forget there is a State Store in the same little strip mall.\n",
      "This is a popular place so usually skip it due to a short wait list...just don't want to wait  for pizza and so many pizza shops in the area.  No wait on this Friday night.  Bado's has  all that you need..a good beer selection, neat atmosphere, and more than pizza..pub grub, lots of options here.  The wait staff was good and on the ball.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the pizza is what most people talk about so we ordered \"Bado's  Famous Pizza\"   (the traditional, Our most popular crust)\" and the hot wings.  It did not take long and the pizza and wings came out.  The wings were hotter than most places and pretty good.  The pizza crust was a little thicker and nice flavor and chewy, good though I tend to prefer thinner crust.  All in all, a nice place, good beer, good service and food.\n",
      "Stopped in on our way out of the Ross Park Mall.  Guess shopping makes us hungry.  We sat at the bar and our service was great.  We received bread and dipping oil to start.  I ordered from the lunch duo of a 7\" pizza and salad.  A nice meal at a fair price. Enjoyed the pizza with a good crust and had the Mediterranean salad.  Was not a fan of the salad because the dressing is a mustard herb vinaigrette that is just to mustardy, while I do enjoy mustard, the mustard overwhelmed any other taste of the salad.\n",
      "Hot diggity dog!  A good hot dog place to replace my fave DD.\n",
      "If you like a plain dog or one of the specialties of the house, you won't be disappointed.  A great place to get a quick dog and take the kids.  I have had the Smokehouse with fries and was so pleased.  The menu includes a Mac & Cheese dog - oreo cheesecake squares - chicken and a veggie.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Only one small hightop table so it is really take out.  \n",
      "But if in the mood for a dog, this is the place!\n",
      "Just don't get it!  \n",
      "We had early reservations on a Saturday a couple of weeks ago.  I was so frustrated after, I decided to wait to write this review.  We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation, the hostess looked at us and did not say a word just kept talking with some other staff.  After 5 minutes she asked if she could help us.  She then took us to our table of 4, it was the first table on the left side in the middle row.  Not a good selection and there were two tables for 4 available in the front and one in the very back.  One chair was very close to a chair of another table and within minutes the hostess used that way to take people to the table in the back instead of going around the other side that had plenty of room.  Well the hostess bumped my chair, knock my jacket off and kept on walking.  A waiter picked up my jacket.  The 4 people behind her bumped my chair also.  So now waiters and the food runners come by and all bump my chair.  This continues and I try to reposition my chair.  The waiter who picked up my jacket started to go around the other side of our table.  The hostess came by again and bumped my chair and knocked my jacket off the chair and kept on going.  The couple following picked up my jacket.   So we put my jacket on a different chair.  In the first 30 minutes the chair was bumped over 30 times.  Quite counting at that point.  \n",
      "Our waitress was not able to explain a question on a menu item but did get the information.  When our appetizer came out we were short on silverware and had to ask our waitress.  \n",
      "As to the food it was pretty good but we did not stay for desert because I felt like a pinball in a pinball machine.  \n",
      "So if you go be aware of how your chair is located because the staff will just keep on bumping it.\n",
      "Met a friend for lunch that, like me, had not been to BD in quit a long time.  \n",
      "If you are into beers, this is a great spot.\n",
      "Like some of the brownish mural type painting on the wall along with the big old bar.  \n",
      "Our server was the bartender who was handling the entire place, was very nice and efficient.  Did forget my soup, until reminded.  The Curry Crab soup was very good with a lot of curry and crab flavor.  The Eric Poster Tacos of pulled pork on corn shells (two tacos) were large and topped with fresh salsa and scallions.  The meat had a nice smoke flavor and was very juicy...sloppy to eat.  \n",
      "Nice place for a cold one and a good meal.\n",
      "We stopped for a cone.  There was a disorganized line and it was hard to read the items available due to lack of light and all the people.  Then the guy in the window is a grouch!  Not sure why he was so grouchy but oh well, wished him a nice day and he shut the window.  The ice cream was good.  Not sure what brand,  Asked for a cone and the grouch did not ask what type of cone just gave us waffle cones.  We sat on the patio in the back that did not have any lights at all, probably should put in a few low watt lights so you can see where you are walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be nice to be able to have a business survive due to location not because of good service and product!\n",
      "Next time we will go elsewhere for our ice cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meter maids were walking the street and parking lot giving lots of tickets, so be sure to find the parking station and put in you money and license #.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash Only!\n",
      "Yo! Check it out!\n",
      "Tacos have been added to the menu.  A tofu, veggie, brisket, fried squid, shrimp, pork shoulder and a few more.  Station Street has a variety of tacos with interesting toppings that create some interesting blending of flavors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These aren't your homemade tacos, if that is what you are looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tacos are a little more expensive but worth the price for what you get.  The Shrimp taco has some pineapple onion and a homemade sauce.  The brisket meat was nice with a little smoke flavor and scallions and other toppings  Both were very good.\n",
      "OK, your mailer ad has a picture of a Brick Oven.  Where is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Called for pick up to try some brick oven pizza due to the ad...did not see a brick oven only regular pizza ovens.  Well, the pizza is thin crust and good and better then many of the local pizza shops but not brick oven.  Also, had some wings and they were average at best.\n",
      "\"A Unique Family Pizzaria\", exclaims the menu.   I agree!\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped by for lunch between appointments in the area.  A nice little house was converted and the inside nicely painted and decorated with a high ceiling and upstairs window letting the more light in.  Hardwood floors and walls with ivy painted around the windows.   An outdoor deck, but not at this time of year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The place was crowded with some families, young kids and mother's, business people.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Homemade soup, wedding comes in a huge bowl and is very good. Pepperoni's has lunch specials and the pricing is amazing.  Soup, salad (it is huge), and bread sticks for $7.99,  or two slices of pizza with one topping and a drink for $5.99.   Homemade sauce for the pizza.  The menu also has Hoagies & Sandwiches, Salads, appetizers,  Calzones, and Pasta with homemade sauce, and homemade deserts.   Managed to get a few bites of Neapolitan style pizza and it is very good, too.  They do make Sicilian and deep dish pizza, also.\n",
      "Good food!\n",
      "Good service!\n",
      "Way to load!\n",
      "Why are all the newer places not taking noise into consideration when they design and build the restaurant!\n",
      "We tried a couple of appetizers, the mussels and cheddar board were very good.  Liked the apple butter and fried fruit with the cheese board.\n",
      "The Steak & Ale Pie was good with tender short rib and some veggies.  \n",
      "We tried two deserts.  The banana bread with a delicious banana ice cream and the Whitepot, a classic English bread and butter pudding with creme anglaise, which I found to be just OK.\n",
      "Yay, I had a really good breakfast with great service. Not fancy but a good Easter Breakfast/Brunch.  One of the smaller locations but it is clean and service was great.  Was thinking omelette but the Grilled Stickies Smile caught my eye or stomach.  It was really good, homemade grilled stickies topped with a honey sauce, two eggs cooked perfectly and 3 slices of tasty bacon...so delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "My cup was refilled many times and the waiter was really nice and made a few suggestions to some in the party!\n",
      "Good food.  Scott is a good chef and his wife was our waitress.\n",
      "Learned well from his grandmother.\n",
      "Pasta is from Italy.  Everything is homemade and fresh.  The linguine scampi and shrimp was delicious.  The Mozzarella Marinara is good fresh mozzarella with a very tasty roma marinara.  The Penne Amaticiana is a very aggressive spicy dish!\n",
      "\n",
      "Only issue is the the Brookline Pub is connected and you go in the side door at the smoking area outside the Pub and it  somehow gets into the restaurant and lingers in the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has chicken, a salad and soup and lots of pasta.  If you like good pasta, you will enjoy Piatto!\n",
      "\n",
      "Piatto gets its alcohol form the Pub.  Someone in the restaurant did BYOB and Lauren said it was $5 charge.  Next time will BYOB.\n",
      "AAAwwww.  Happy Hour!  Sonic is the Ultimate Drink Stop.   Missed lunch and was starved and noticed Sonic...Oh yeah!  It was Happy Hour!  Had the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly, not a thin patty that most fast food places use and so tasty.   Sonic burgers and fries are pretty good.   Had some fries and the fries are OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Happy Hour I enjoyed the LIme Limeade.  Delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fun place to visit in nice weather!\n",
      "D's, Oh D's.  What a fun place to hang out, walk thru the beer cave and drool...also select a few beers to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it is not gourmet, U can have a gourmet dog.  The root beer is great, too.  So bring the kids.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Friendly but gruff service! lol!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Try the fries with chili or cheese! or the pimped up Pub fries!  Yum!   They have other food but I tend to get a dog, my fav is the Chicago Dog.\n",
      "Ok, popular place...Why because of price and huge portions.  We had six.  Were told 20 minute wait on a mid-week night.  One hour and 20 minutes later we were seated.  There were a two more groups of six behind us and the had a longer wait.  Warm bread with butter and dipping oil were good.  I had the fettuccini alfredo that was rich and creamy on some good pasta that was al dente.  Had enough to take home for another meal and then still had some leftover. Not sure how anyone can have desert when you get so much to eat.\n",
      "All chi-pote-lay(sp) stores seem to be alike, sort of.  The food is quite similar, the service is usually similar, too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You get some pretty good food at a reasonable price and relatively fast.  But this location is crowded and never seems to have any open tables.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Have noticed they have changed the signage, less description.  Not sure why?!  That made it harder for some first timers in our group.  It was noisy and hard to hear the staff explaining the salsa's and different types of  meat selections to the beginners.  Still a fan of the food but maybe a few more tables and better signage would speed up the process.\n",
      "El Paso is an inexpensive authentic mexican restaurant.  Above each table/booth there is a mural, that I found out, portrays Dia dl los Muertos, the holiday in which families remember there deceased relatives...OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed one large TV screen with the sound on mute, was told they play Mexican soccer games.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do have margaritas, beer and I think Sangria.  The place was very crowded.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good.  Immediately received warm chips and salsa.  Salsa was good but like mine a little spicier.  Of course after the meal, found out they do have a more spicy salsa, if you ask.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had a taco, enchilada and beans.  The taco was bland, came with meat that was very bland and a little overcooked, white cheese (white american?) and lettuce.  The enchilada was better with a zesty red sauce.\n",
      "Spoon, one of the better restaurants in the Burgh.  The decor is nice and tables are far enough apart to make it intimate.  \n",
      "Service was outstanding from our waiter, to the other servers that assisted, to John the Sommelier.  John spent a little time with us with several recommendations that would go with our mix of dinner orders.  He actually highly recommended a bottle that was one of the least expensive on the wine list.  He got it right, too, very nice cabaret franc.\n",
      "The bread basket was very good, probably could have eaten bread all night.\n",
      "Interesting menu with many fresh items.  We shared a grilled avocado that came with a charred tomato vinaigrette, oven roasted tomato and some creamy burrito.  We also had the bleu cheese souffle that had french peaches, nectarines, plums and a nice arugula with a sweet and sharp vinaigrette. I had a pork and shrimp dinner that was very good, the pork was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was good but maybe a tad over cooked but still tasty and good. All of the meals had some interesting ingredients that introduced some very tasty meals.  The preparation and presentation was top notch.\n",
      "Nice little Peruvian spot.  Chicken is moist and pretty tasty, especially if you use the green chili hot sauce. The fries were pretty standard and crisp, just add salt and they are pretty good.  I thought the prices were very good.  Sorry I didn't see the plantains on the menu until after I was finished, they looked pretty good.\n",
      "Better than some reviews.  Guess it depends on the night.  Went late evening after kayaking on the river.  Sat outside and waited....Waitresses both thought it was the other's table.  After that, service was good.  Was crowded.  Had the crab cake sandwich, which was pretty good...better than I expected from this type of establishment and not to much breading.  Pizza was good, the pasta dish was OK.  Beer not draft//why??? Wines were below par//Why???  Was pleasantly surprised!\n",
      "Just stopped in for a drink with friends after a meeting in town.  Cool space with open window on the street and a couple of fire/heaters.  KDKA with David Highfield and Susan K were there filming something...will have to check to see what they were up to if I get a chance.  Anyway, for a drink it was good...good service and a good drink.\n",
      "We had a good time and good service.  The brussel sprouts were the best.  My Banh Mi shrimp tacos were just OK, shrimp was overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavor.  Everyone enjoyed there meal and they have a few beers on tap (150).\n",
      "Eat at Bob's.  A new diner from this small group of diners has opened in USC.  Nice and new and clean.  Our waitress was new and being trained or assisted by a veteran.  The service and food was good.   Tried the Dad's favorite.  Two eggs over easy cooked perfectly, bacon that was over cooked, sausage, a very large pancake that was good that had a sweet syrup, and some Mancini's raisin bread.  Did not leave hungry!\n",
      "Two types of pies!  Oh my!  Then I found out about the lunch buffet.  Wow! Lots of varied food and a salad bar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, a great service person who replenished the buffet and also waited on tables when she had time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza's on the buffet change so if you don't like the toping, just wait 5 or so minutes a new different pizza comes out.  Had two styles of pasta, one was a cream sauce with chicken the other was marinara, both good.  Pizza was good too!  They had a hoagie sandwich on the buffet but was to full to try it. Also, there was a little desert some type of fried cookie.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't beat this buffet for lunch and the place was hopping!  Place was full of people that worked nearby.\n",
      "Stopped by for a bite and a brew.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Great spot to have some good times in the neighborhood.  There were many having some fun on the Pool Table in the back room.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer and wine list are not long but there are some good selections.  \n",
      "The menu is limited.   The burgers are hand made using a custom blend of sirloin, brisket and short ribs.  Cooked on a little grill at the end of the bar.  \n",
      "The Fired Egg, Bacon, Potatoes, Hot Sauce Mayo Burger was tasty and juicy.  A two napkin burger.  The potatoes were tasty.  The mayo on the burger was limited or almost nonexistent, had to ask for a little more.  My associate had the Portobello Mushroom & Swiss burger, said it was delicious.\n",
      "If you are looking for authentic Sichuan cuisine, with the bold flavors, SG is your place.  The menu is large and some of the most popular are written on a black board on the wall.  This location is not a large and it was full the day we dined.  \n",
      "We tried several items to share and all were very good.  The spicy lamb was tasty and as it is called had some very nice spice flavors.  The Pork with vermicelli was another very good dish.  We had a Sichuan rice that was also a good rice dish with some peppers to add some flavor.  One of the dishes we ordered was a chicken dish, but I did not get the name and it was probably the best dish of the evening.  \n",
      "We really enjoyed our meal, the prices are very reasonable and we had plenty of leftovers for another meal.\n",
      "Updated interior from the previous place.  Looks good and they got rid of the awful booths. Our waitress was very good and answered our questions.  Luckily it was cool outside, they had a couple of fans running and pulling in some outside air; must be a air conditioning issue. \n",
      "Ordered the Buffalo Bleu Mac which I enjoyed but nothing special.  Looking forward to coming back and trying one of the sandwiches.\n",
      "Still very good pizza.  Don't get out this way much be we had a good lunch at TOPC. Have always been a fan of the pizza and today I had the Margarita.  Cooked perfectly with a nice crust.  You can get a whole 14 inch pizza or just slices.  Nice outdoor area but a little to cool to enjoy it.\n",
      "Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.\n",
      "Can I say Oy!  We had a group of seven.  All tables are for 4.  We put two tables together.  A table of 3 came in right before us and someone was waiting for take out.  When we ordered we   were told a couple of items would take a little bit but that was OK.  So we waited and waited.   We waited and waited. 70 minutes after our order, two dinners came out.  10 minutes later 3 dinners came out.  Finally, after 90 minutes the sushi and last 2 dinners came out.  The Miso soup was served first and was not warm enough.  A couple of people called in for take out and came to pick it up and waited for long periods, one was given a bowl of Miso soup while she waited.   The food was good but the wait was over the top.  \n",
      "The place is loud, the ventilation fan has a very high hum and made it hard to hear someone talking if you were at one end of the table and they were at the other end of the table.\n",
      "Probably should just do take out and be ready to wait.\n",
      "Cibo Di Strada (Sicilian Street Food!).   Homemade dough for the bread and great tasting Arancini (Little Oranges - filled with risotto and bolognese with peas.  Delicious!  \n",

      "\n",
      "The Thai items on the menu caught my eye or was it my taste buds.  Enjoyed the Pad Thai Shrimp, while the menu states it is spicy, not to much, was expecting more spice.  Sampled another Pad Thai, forgot the name, and it was not as spicy as I was expecting but good.  The Amazing Chicken turn out to be not so amazing.  It was OK but expected more.     \n",
      "\n",
      "SI is popular and I can see why.  Nice place and good service.\n",
      "Simple little family run place with tables and TV with sports on.  Wings are specialty but have wraps, sandwiches and salads.   There must be 9 or 10, maybe more, types of wings with cajun, bbg, honey bbq, Hey Mon jamaican, and more.  Was with a friend who likes the wraps and jamaican wings.  Tried the hot bbq wings...they were good.  Also had some fries, that look to be fresh cut on the premises.   They do delivery to the area.\n",
      "Had a smorgasboard of items since we ordered lots of stuff to stuff our faces.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Dynamo hoagie is steak and cheese with lots of fixings was dynamite!  The Italian hoagie was fun to eat with some pepper in some of the meat and not as sloppy as my fav.  The pizza is very good with a thin soft crust with a nice sauce with just enough spices.\n",
      "Great French fries!\n",
      "Apple chicken salad was so good!\n",
      "Turkey burger was good too.\n",

      "While I don't get to BT very often, probably over 2 years now, it is one of my favorite restaurants.  The Chef has won some great awards, embraces the Farm to Table movement and it shows in his final product.  Of course, love the BYOB too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went with some friends who go to BT a couple of times a year.  We all brought a bottle of wine to share with our meals.  Many interesting choices and service was very quiet and prefect.  Had a Cous Cous appetizer which was very good with a wonderful combination of tastes.  The Veal Chop was perfectly cooked, very tender and came with some very good potato and veggie.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Save room for desert.  The chocolate cake with homemade ice cream was rich, sweet and a table favorite. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is a little hard to find so make sure you have the address.  The decor is a darker colored and nothing special, somewhat minimalist.   The food is what makes this a great restaurant.  Great place for special occasions.\n",
      "Like the name...Blue...an interesting restaurant.  Enjoyed our visit.  A big drink menu with lots of martini's and beers.  Decent wine selection by the glass.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the main reason for the visit was Diva Tuesday...Jazz..Female vocalists...Jessica Lee was great!  Have music every Tuesday.  Thought it was from 9 to 11 so showed up at 9...missed first hour cause it is 8 to 10...bummer.   Another couple showed up at 10 and thought the same time and found out the kitchen closed at 10... they were able to get some hummus.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sampled two appetizers - the hummus and bruschetta with basil/pesto.  Both were very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was OK, busy and noticed the table next to us had to have the bill corrected for to many drinks...probably a honest mistake but...I always wonder about this type of mistake!\n",
      "Stopped in after being at Stage AE for the Sumo Showdown.  Bar area was pretty full when we arrived but we managed to get a table that was just being cleaned.  \n",
      "Our waitress was terrible!  \n",
      "We ordered drinks and one app. and stated that we would be ordering more apps. once we had our drinks.  The drinks took a little bit and our waitress disappeared before we could order more apps.  Then she did stop by and looked at us and said, Oh Yea you ordered an app.  She ran and picked up our app. and started to run away! Ha!  We were able to get her attention and did order more apps.   During all of this a few more people showed up at our table and not service. Those apps. did show up pretty soon and then she did refill some drinks and take the other drink orders.  By this time the bar area was about half full. Then no waitress, no cleaning up of all the plates and apps that were on our table, no drink refills.  We put all of the dirty plates on a table nearby.  Those were picked up and finally we were asked if we wanted drink refills.  Then we asked for the check.  She forgot that and we had to ask again about 20 minutes later.\n",
      "We shared a few apps and a steak salad.  The steak salad was good, the Chips & Queso was OK, you do get a fair amount of Queso and Salsa but not enough chips.  The flatbread and quesadilla were also OK.\n",
      "So Good!  A interesting menu of about 4 pies with a Bianco, Margherita, Formaggi and Tennessee Pig.  I know they have some others but today these were available.  The Tennessee Pig peaked my interest.  It has smoked bacon and smoked Gouda cheese drizzled with Jack Daniels infused pure maple syrup and topped with walnuts and dabs of ricotta cheese.  Really enjoyed the combination of flavors.  It was a little on the sweet side but since we were sharing the size was about right.  \n",
      "They have a good system and it did not take to long even thought they were busy.  Hats off to Chef Rob who was working the oven and the two associates in the truck.\n",
      "If you are looking for good coffee, tea, or treat, Orbis has it.  Coffee is excellent and the staff is great.  Have met some friends that tend to hang here and have never been disappointed.  Have had a few treats, bagel my last visit was good.  Have not tried but others have had some egg wraps that they said were good.\n",

      "\n",
      "We had a large group and ordered several apps.  Took 50 minutes for the apps.  The wings are OK but about the time we were finishing the wings our waitress finally showed up with plates for everyone and napkins.  Not great to eat a wing and have no place to put the bone.  The nacho's came out cold with some of the worst cold soggy cheese. Meh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally were asked if we wanted to order our meals and it took 45 minutes. Most just ordered some type of burger and most said it was well done, not the way it was ordered.  I chose the Santa Fe wrap and it was OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was so noisy, yea the football games were on.   So if you are not in a hurry or just want some beer this is an OK place.\n",

      "This is really an old bar that the owner is trying to make an Italian restaurant.  Only con is that it is a smoking establishment and we smelled like smoke when leaving due to someone smoking while we were there.  Have 4 TV's over the bar and had a couple of large take out orders when we were there.\n",

      "Didn't realize this place had a different name than was on the sign.  A big Fox's sign, but in the comment area below it had the name of the new pizza shop and more.  There is a gazebo under the trees to eat out and relax.  The menu has home made dishes and a few that are unique. The staff was very friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered a fresh made personal pizza.  It is small but very good.  Crust was cooked perfectly with a perfect pizza texture and taste.  The sauce and cheese made it a very good pie.  \n",

      "When you walk in you know that there is a wood fired grill, smells like my house when I have a fire in the fireplace.\n",
      " \n",
      "My first thought on the menu was to have a burger and wings but then I noticed the Grilled Crab Cake go by on a plate..changed my mind.  The Crab sandwich had apple wood bacon, some romaine lettuce and a tasty sriracha aioli sauce was huge and very good.  A little sloppy to eat but very satisfying.  A side of thick fresh cut fries came with and were soft and tasty.\n",
      "When hunger strikes, Fiori's is a great option.  At a party with friends just up the teeth rattling hill from Fiori's.  Called and ordered 10 pizzas in many styles.   They gave us a time and sure enough they were ready on time.  The pizza was a hit and all but a few slices were finished.  The sauce is a little sweet but it was good and the crust was cooked just right.\n",
      "Really nice decor with the windows open to the covered patio tonight.  \n",
      "A great night to dine under the stars.  \n",
      "The place was busy with 8 fish selections, 4 shell fish from the Meditareannean or North Atlantic.  There is also some lamb on the menu.\n",
      "the drink and wine menu is extensive with wine from many countries that are not usually on a restaurant menu.\n",

      "\n",
      "My associate had eggs and bacon and said \"the eggs were perfect and you could  tell they were fresh, not out of a box\".   Later our waitress confirmed that and went on to explain how they work with local farmers to make everything as fresh as possible.  The rolls from the bakery were fresh and good.   Enjoyed the coffee, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price it can't be beat.\n",
      "What a Gem.  In a old white house with food like your Italian grandmother made (OH Yeah, I'm not Italian, like you think an Italian grandmother would make).  The inside is like walking into someone's older house with larger tables and chairs.  \n",

      "You are served fresh homemade Tuscan bread that must be meant for dipping in your salad or sauces. Yum!  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ordered the Chicken Salad which has hot green beans (fresh) and carrots  (fresh) with tomatoes (fresh), black olives and shredded cheese on some fresh lettuce with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing.

      "Ordered take out but not real crowded when picked up the meal.  Wonton soup and Egg roll were good starters.  The Twice Cooked POrk with cabbage sweet red and green peppers and spicy sauce was very good.  Nice flavors, tender meat and veggies.  Also, had some fried rice which was pretty ordinary.\n",

      "Now if you want a gastropub that has high end food and libations, M&P is the place. \n",
      "Nice decor with nice high back seats and a large bar in the middle of the room. The bar was full and so was the restaurant on a Sunday night before the Pirate Dodger game, with many in team colors for both teams.  Some nice up beat music playing.  \n",
      "Service was on point.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the Cobb salad that had bacon lardons, tomatoes, egg, scallions, some great blue cheese and a avocado ranch dressing.  A great start to our dinner.  For a appetizer we ordered the Lobster Mac that has some black truffle.  The mac was good, especially when you had a chunk of the lobster or truffle. Two people in our group split the Meat & Potatoes for Two (34 oz. ribeye, confit stay fries, mushroom argue and bone marrow gratin.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The bone marrow was perfect sweet combination.  The confit potatoes were very good with a nice crunch and flavor.  The Pork Chop, ordered by someone at our table, looked great and was told it was top notch.\n",
      "Another enjoyable meal.  Have found with a few visits that like every restaurant there are some items that I enjoy much more than other items. ordered the Chicken n Cake, some tasty and moist chicken with three large Bakn-stuffed cakes.

      "The deli is brightly painted with a darker red ceiling and border and yellow walls.\n",
      "My Cevapi was served on a house made bread, with onion and a red pepper spread (Ajvar, spelling is a guess). The bread is moist and tasty, really good, the Ajvar is a little sweet and very good, and the sausage are a combo of beef and veal were OK but I would prefer a little more flavor, the Ajvar and onions were a nice combo.  I understand that they do have a spicer sausage, next time.\n",
      "Stopped by at lunch on a recommendation.  Was told it is good thinner crust pizza.  When I walked in a large thicker crust square pizza was coming out of the oven.  Upon ordering, Alex said I'll just give you this since it just come out of the oven, so you don't have to wait.   The crust was thicker with a nice chewy taste.  The sauce had some Italian spices.   A good pizza.  Not sure if they make thinner crust of not but the pictures on the hand out menu had pictures of both a round and square pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has hummus with pita bread, hoagies, burgers, gyros, and salads.\n",
      "Slice has opened up at a second location in Carnegie.  Get the same good pizza.  Check out the funny named specialty pizza or order it your way.  The pizza is a thinner crisp crust which I prefer.  The sauce is pretty good too.  The Slice philosophy is to make as much as possible from scratch and use good fresh ingredients. \n",
      "\n",
      "The shop is in a little store front with about 5 tables and a few seats in the window.   Also a little room with a big bank type vault door in the back.  It was pretty hot in the shop since it is not air conditioned.  So at this time of year you may want to take out. \n",

The menu seems to be healthy and from my salad very satisfying.  The ingredients are fresh with house made dressings. \n",
      "My Piquillo Pork Chimichurri salad was delicious.  It had some panic-fried pork belly, Piquillo Pepper, Pickled Red Onion, Tomato, Cucumber, Arugula and I chose the Rustic Chimichurri dressing.   Received a small roll and butter with the salad.  Just like most salad shops, I thought a little more protein could had been in the salad but it still was a very tasty lunch.\n",

Maybe next visit we will have one of the For the Table/appetizers.\n",

You enter an old restaurant that use to be Chinese, I think, with dated walls and tables.  The sign says to order at the counter and the food will be delivered to your table but the waitress said to sit anywhere and she would serve us.  The chalk board has specials and a BYOB sign.  After reviewing the menu, ordered the house smoked BBQ Beef Brisket that has a tangy BBQ sauce, homemade onion straws on a hard roll and a pickle.  The brisket was delicious with some smoky BBQ flavor and a nice tangy sauce.  The onion straws were perfect for the sandwich.  \n",

Some very interesting flavors that combined well.  Did not meet the challenge.  Had to take some home for a nice treat the next day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great beer selection, too.\n",
      "Good place to meet some friends.  We had a large group meet at Duke's to have a little holiday cheer.  Service was good considering how crowded it was.   The bar was overwhelmed by our group and another group.  We had some pizza and wings.  The pizza had a medium crust and was good.  The wings were somewhat crispy and tasted good.\n",
      "Wow!  Remind me why it has been so long.  What a little gem of a place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is like visiting the country.   \n",
      "\n",
      "A very good ethnic restaurant that specializes in Moroccan food.  The chef and another women run the kitchen, with a few waitresses.   The dinner menu has some great selections, though it is small.  But then again, the restaurant is small and you get fresh ingredients with authentic flavors of Morocco and a chef that cooks all the meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went with a few friends, and you better have reservations on the weekends.  The crusty, chewy bread was great; it came with an olive oil dip.  We shared the veggie hummus that came with a slightly chewy grilled pita and beet salad...both were tasty, fresh and delicious.   Next I had a special of lamb chops that were tender and cooked perfectly.  The lamb was perfect with a sweet and spicy sauce and some grilled veggies.  \n",

      "We had the table by the kitchen and could look in and see the chef at work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is tiny and tables are close, so it gets a little noisy.  Try not to get the table in front of the door.  Our waitress was OK but did not know what each person ordered,   she just asked.  \n",

      "My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!\n",

      "Had a coupon for pizza, wings and cheese bread.  The pizza is good with a crust that is not thin but not to thick and the sauce is simple, not to spicy and maybe a little on the sweet side.  The topping were fresh and good!  Liked the wings, crisp and tasty with just the right amount of heat.\n",

      "During the holidays stopped by the Salem's Market to buy a few items and some meat from the butcher area.  Very helpful staff at the butcher counter.\n",
      "We also stopped in the Grill for a quick meal.  Most others have already covered the essentials...ie;  cafeteria style, give you a number and they will bring it to you or you get up and get it when you number is called...someone was cleaning the tables and trying to keep up with the number of customers but it was busy.  I had the Kufta sandwich and fries.  The Kufta was very tasty and as others have said, the fries are really good.  For dessert had a pistachio mamaol that was delicious. If you looking for Gyros, Sharamas, fresh baked items Mediterranean sweets this a good place for a meal or taking home.\n",
      "Yum! Yum! Yum homemade soup!  Second visit and have tried the homemade soup both times.  Nothing like a good bowl of soup on some of these overcast cold days to warm the body and put a sparkle in the mind!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the tomato pepper jack soup.  So tasty creamy rich tomato with the sharp pepper jack.  Had the Reuben Gone Fishin'..fresh talapia with coleslaw, swiss and russian dressing...very good and a little sloppy.  Great combination.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Meet some friends and everyone tried one of the soups.  I think they had 4 available.  Everyone was pleased!   Also, BYOB and we did! Nice place to eat and visit with friends over a warm soup and glass of wine.\n",
      "Love the concept.  With 4 places to eat it took a while to figure out what I wanted to eat.  Will have to come back and try some of the other chefs.  \n",
      "A great place for lunch.  Not real crowded and was able to talk with a couple of the chefs for a short time as they were preparing some food for the day.  \n",

      "The bar had some nice choices of beer too.  Unfortunately, since I had some meetings after lunch had to skip that part.\n",
      "Stopped by after reading Darren's review.   Unfortunately, that bbq has close, but...a new place has already opened in its place.  Was talking with our server and he said they opened on April 4.  The previous bbq that was in this location was only open about one to two months and closed.  The building owner worked with Swhinery to open up. \n",

      "\n",
      "The food is good.  The Blackened tuna with sesame had some nice flavors and definitely had sesame favor, was cooked perfectly and was a great meal.  The ribs are good.  The ribs come with the Swhinery bbq sauce that is a little sweet but has some sharpness.  There is a Hot Swhinery bbq sauce that I preferred.  Also, a mustardy Carolina sauce is available.  Was surprised at the variety on the menu.\n",
      "Stopped in for Brunch.  Some interesting items on the menu and a lot of different style  burgers.  Ordered the Brisket hash.  The brisket was little cubes on top of the shredded potatoes with some red pepper and an egg on top.  The hash was good and enjoyed the flavor of the brisket.  A side of toast with apple butter came with the hash.\n",
      "Still a great place for Dogs!  They still do the fixings right!  My fav is the Illinois Dog, similar to a Chicago dog.  Yes, it was good!  Yes, the buns are fresh from the bakery!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some very interesting dogs with all the fixings!  Most named after Dormont streets. Tried a Buffalo Dog too.  While not as good as by FAV, the Illinois Dog, interesting to have buffalo sauce and blue cheese on a Dog!\n",
      "Another child or should I say grandchild of the old Oasis that was in Heidelberg. After being seated a woman stopped by to see if we remembered her. It was Laura, from the old Oasis. Her granddaughter is running the L.O. and has many of the old recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the homemade spaghetti with marinara sauce. The spaghetti was real good, nice noodles and zesty sauce. Homemade Chicken Pastina soup was good. You get a standard salad and some Italian bread with the meal. Had the small plate and it was large enough for a good meal with a bit left over. A dining companion had the gnocchi, large, and took half home for tomorrow's dinner. Another had the Veal Romano, three pieces of veal, large, but was over-breaded and said that it tasted more like fried bread than veal.\n",
      "Interesting space that has the event space of City of Asylum connected to the main floor bar and dining area.  Stopped in for a bite to eat and listen to a reading.  The place was actually not noisy and when the reading and speakers started the dining area got quieter.  \n",
      "I realize this place has not been open long so they need to work out the kinks.  Our server was very good but new and could not discuss the items on the menu but was willing to get the person in charge of the cheeses to discuss the cheeses.  So we ordered some wine and looked at the menu to get some lighter items.  We decided to try the Peppadews and some cheese.  We selected 3 cheeses that come with a small accompaniment.  The Peppadews came out in a reasonable time but the cheese took over one hour.   When the cheese server came she described the cheeses and the accompaniments...one of the cheeses we ordered they were out of, so she substituted something similar. That was OK but she probably should have asked first.  She also gave us an extra cheese that was one of her favorites due to the wait.  The cheeses were delectable and we really enjoyed the tasting with the accompaniments.  Each cheese was $6.\n",
      "Would like to see some connection with some of the wines & cheeses so we amateurs could try to pair the wine with cheese.  Thought the wines a little on the expensive side.\n",
      "Looking forward to coming back and trying some other items and cheeses. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a none tipping restaurant, so the tip is included in the price.\n",
      "Love trying some of the ethnic restaurants.  Tana Ethiopian provides Ethopian cuisine and it is designed for sharing.  Quite a change from the old Sliberty that was mostly Italian.  The space is large but we were given a table by the window, so it seemed smaller.   It also was sparsely seated, but it was a Tuesday, so probably a slow night.  The room temperature was almost cold.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Though the food is made for sharing but there were only 2 of us so did not have much opportunity.  Had the Minchet Abish Alicha Wot, a ground beef cooked in a sauce that was suppose to be hot.  While Ethiopian food is suppose to be spicy, I found this to be mild not hot.  The hot tea with spices was spicy and very enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will have to come back with a group so we can sample more of the food!\n",
      "If you are looking for a delicious Southern cooking/meal, go to Nana's. Nice little take out place in Bloomfield.  The menu and the super sweet lady behind the counter said, \"it would take about 20 minutes to prepare my order\".  I ordered chicken wings without any sauce and they were cooked perfectly with some very moist and tasty chicken.  For sides I ordered the mac & cheese and yams.  The mac & cheese was delicious with a lot of cheese, one of the better I have had.  The Yams were forgotten, did not get them with my order.  A corn muffin came with the meal, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The walls are painted red and there are a few pictures of Nana on the wall.  There are plenty of nice soft chairs to sit and wait, or call ahead.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cash only!\n",
      "Stopped by with a few friends for a cold one and a sandwich.  We started with some bacon wrapped asparagus...very tasty.  I chose the Poppin My Collar because I had to try one of the grilled cheese.  This sandwich had sautéed shrimp, fresh jalapeños, chipotle mayo, mushrooms and of course provolone cheese.  The sandwich was tasty and really enjoyed the flavors.  I thought the tomato soup was a tad bitter.   \n",
      "The service was good with prompt refills and our waitress stopped by a few times to check on how everything was.\n",
      "If you are looking for some good Mexican food, you can get some authentic bites at Totopo.  Good Margarita's and Sangria, too!\n",
      "We went for a late dinner and the place was still full and it is rather large with seating in front, big bar and seating in the back.  We were seated in a few minutes and our server was great.  We received some warm tortilla chips and salsa.  After ordering a few drinks our server came back and said that the bartender had a lot of orders and it would be a few minutes.  After a about 10 minutes our drinks arrived.  We place our orders and they took about 30 minutes to arrive.  We actually enjoyed our time talking, sipping our drinks and received a second batch of tortilla chips while we waited.  But I am sure that many would not want to wait this long for their meal.  Being a large place and new, the kitchen seems to have a hard time getting the orders out but the food was good.  I was told that the Cilantro lie chicken tacos and chicken chorizo tacos were good but did not get a taste.  I had the Shrimp enchiladas with green peppers and tomatoes that was topped with a so called spicy creamy guajillo sauce and some cotjia cheese that comes with cilantro rice and black beans.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly but I thought the spicy guajillo sauce really needed a little more spice.  The cilantro rice was very good.  \n",
      "All in all the food was good, service from our waiter was very good but the kitchen was a little slow.  Will return to try some of the especiales. Happy hora from 4-6 and daily drink specials.\n",
      "Check it out.  Great location overlooking the lake.  Nice view.  If your are biking, running or just looking to relax this is a good spot.  Many beers on tap and nice menu with some vegetarian options.  The place was busy.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget the soup, like our waitress did!  Good soup, soup of the day was a vegetarian Southwest.  Very good with some nice spiciness.  Pedal paddle panini was loaded with mozzarella, roasted red peppers, sliced tomato and fresh basil.  Very good, wish it had a tad more basil thou.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our waitress worked hard and was busy but could probably use a few training sessions.\n",
      "Wood fired Neapolitan pizza and pastas.   Love the Wine Bar.  Many Italian wines to try, although a little pricy. The Wine Bar is in the building in the back, go thru the back door and up the steps.  They have a little fire place with one log burning.  Nice place to sit and sip wine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had to wait to be seated in the restaurant so went to the wine bar and met a few different people - the people were all very friendly and made it seem like we were regulars.  Had the Doc Margherita pizza. It was very good with fresh buffalo mozzarella and basil.  Have been here a few times and have tried some pasta's and other pizza's and have found some to be very good but others were rather bland...so the consistency may not be there.  Il Piz. does have a quite a few different specialty style pizza's and seem to have mostly fresh ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see why people really like this place and return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was fine for a crowded restaurant.  Was a little loud.\n",
      "Went with a big group for a celebration.  Service was really good.  Had two wait staff attending the group.  Had to wait for a few people but they seated us immediately and made sure we had drinks and appetizers - split flatbread Roma, Cheese ravioli artichoke & spinach formaggio - nice way to start.  Had the mista salad, very fresh greens and nice gorgonzola cheese and vinaigrette.  Had Margherita Pizza which was OK.\n",
      "Service was excellent.  Waitress was top notch.  Able to answer questions.   Folded our napkins when someone went to see some friends or the bathroom.   Another helped with the great wine list.  Hard to get service like this.  The place was full, so surprised how excellent the service was. \n",
      "\n",
      "The caesar salad was one of the best I have had with fresh parmesan, anchovies fresh romaine.  The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and very tasty with a pistachio and apricot crumb.\n",

      "Don't forget it is BYOB!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the small mixed app. platter that has 5 items.  All were very good.  Loved the Baba,Tabuli, Haydari & Piyaz.  My Shish Kebab of char-broiled lamb cubes that is marinated came with rice and grilled tomato and peppers.  Too my surprise, the lamb cubes were overcooked and very tough.  Actually did not finish due to how tough the meat was.  Everyone else at the table was very pleased with their meal.  I guess I ordered the wrong meal.\n",
      "Still load music, but we were seated in back room and music was not on there.  Good start.  We did have to wait for a table and hostess made sure we knew how long and was very helpful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the Buffalo BBQ Burger, is suppose to have Buffalo BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Only had a dollop of BBQ sauce so basically one bit had the taste...that was it.  Ordered the burger medium it came out well...so tasteless..so overcooked.  Waitress brought Mac & cheese as a side, but I ordered the Sweet fries...she checked her slip and corrected immediately...good job!  Left the Mac & Cheese for us also (Oh So Good) Good Sweet Fries!  S had Build a Mac Skillet that was Oh So Good!  The MAC may be the best thing on the menu...Oh Yes I stole a few bites...more than a few.   Also had the Homemade Potato Chips and they were over cooked.  I like my chips crispy and cooked but this was overcooked/fried...to bad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yea, the burgers and MAC come in hot skillets that meal is cooked in.\n",

      "Came for the wings.  Ordered hot and they were not hot but they were OK.  Typical average wings you can get many places.  Service was good.\n",
      "Nice area with an outdoor deck.  Friendly service.  Only ordered some Chip and Dip from the Fore D'Oeuvres and had a drink but looks like a nice place for some pub grub after hitting some golf balls.  I think they had 4 or 5 beers on tap.  The menu is on a large TV and of course some hand menu's.  Will have to stop back and grab some lunch or dinner.\n",
      "Dragon Fire just open recently.  Great looking with dark wood paneling, dark ceiling.  Lots of options; Robata, Hibachi, and large Sushi bar.  So many choices so little stomach...will have to come back to try some of the options.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped in for lunch and had a really friendly server.  She said there would be a patio in May. There are about 10 draft beers available.  The Sushi bar was crowded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the Robata Grilled Salmon salad which was on mizuna greens, with candied cashews, mandarins, red pepper, and sweet soy vinaigrette.  The salmon was grilled perfectly and the salad was delicious and the vinaigrette was a good match.\n",
      "Create your own pizza (salads too).  Or order one of the bakd creations.  It is fast, fresh and a cafeteria line like Subway and Chipotle.  Takes about 3 or 4 minutes to bake your pizza.  \n",
      "Pick you crust, pick your sauce (8 to chose from), pick your cheese (9 cheeses), pick your toppings of veggies (about 15 varieties) and protein (11 options), add some oil if you wish and/or some finishing flavors.  There are some oils and peppercorn at the drink stand so you can put some on your pizza tray to dip your crust in, too.\n",

      "I created my own pizza with the traditional crust, with the spicy tomato sauce, with pepperoni and Italian hot sausage.  The crust was cooked just right and soft and chewy but with some brown crisp edge.  The spicy tomato sauce was spicy but not to spicy, probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it.  The pepperoni and sausage were good.  The Italian sausage was somewhat hot and not as good as my favorite but was put on in small pieces and better than most pizza shop sausage.\n",
      "Another BSB's popped up.  This location use to be Feeney's Weenies, sorry to see it go.\n",

      "We ordered and picked up over the weekend since we knew we would be driving by.  We tried 3 of the 150 types of wings...Primetime that are sweet and hot with a golden BBQ, the ever so popular Talk of Beaver Falls that are hot and tangy with large pieces of black pepper and the Medium.  All were good.  The wings are crisp with the sauce covering and sloppy to eat. \n",

      "We enjoyed our meal and had very good service.\n",
      "Solid breakfast.  Great service.  Our waitress was a little older and so good.  Bought the food out fast, due to only two arms she would serve a couple of plates and then acknowledge what would be out next. Know when to refill our cups and glasses.  The Blueberry Pancakes were good with plump fresh blueberries, and came with a small pitcher of fresh blueberries with some blueberry sauce.   From experience know to order the short stack and our waitress also advised that it was 3 pancakes.  Plenty to eat.  The bacon was crisp and is very thick.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We always seem to get the front room which is quite noisy, all hard surfaces.  The back room does have carpet, wonder if it is quieter?  Our waitress shifted sides of the table to take orders because she could not here people those at the other end of the table when ordering or their questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My glass and others were plastic with cracks in them.  I mentioned it to our waitress and she said she would look for some without the cracks but most were cracked but did not leak and she would do her best.  Maybe IHOP should try a different glass?\n",

      "\n",
      "Burgers and steaks are cooked on a wood grill.  The burger definitely has that wood grill flavor.  Ordered a medium burger, it was cooked a tad to long and not as juicy as I would expect.   If you like BBQ or wood flavored meat, this is a good option.  The home fries were lacking any real flavor, needing salt and pepper, and could have used some onions or peppers when cooked.  \n",

      "Did not try this visit but the sandwiches are good and huge.\n",
      "Not sure who Skinny Pete is but he mades a mean sandwich.  A small unique lunch and breakfast place.  Had some homemade tomato basil soup and a really tasty Cuban sandwich.   Menu items are kind of gourmet diner food.  There is a brick oven for pizza.  Will have to stop back and try that in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Menu has some interesting sandwiches (Pete-wiches) like the Muffulleta, Evil Mr Pork Chop, Roasted Captain Veggie or you can build your own.  Same idea with the Pizza  on handmade dough,  pick from a couple on the menu pizza or build your own that includes tofu or portabella.  Some Salads, Skinny bread for those that like flatbreads, and a couple pasta dishes. \n",

      "As to the food, the cup of Duck & Sausage gumbo was good and spicy.  A fair amount of sausage but lacking in duck.  Did get a few tiny pieces of duck and it was tender and tasty.  The gumbo is spicy with a lot of jalapeño peppers.  The Fried Shrimp Po Boy was very good.  Plenty of shrimp that was cooked well, nice and tender.  The topping of chili mayo added a lot of spiciness and some heat.  Enjoyed the pickle too.  Po Boy sandwiches can be so different and this is a pretty good rendition of a Po Boy.  Tasty Cajun Fries came with the Po Boy.\n",
      "Stopped in on a cold cloudy day and was promptly greeted.  As others have stated, Stone has large windows overlooking the Point State Park entrance and the Fort Pitt Bridge.  Probably great on a sunny day, but this day.  \n",
      "Nice to have Neapolitan style pizza which is available at a few places but not many downtown.   Stone has a list of specialty pizza with some fresh ingredients or build your own.  So many combinations, you could eat @ Stone every day for a year and probably not have every variety.    There are salads and sandwiches available too.  \n",

      "I split the Vesuvius pizza with a friend. The pizza is a little small..four cutes probably good for one person,  but it was more than I wanted and worked out well as we split it.    Really a good flavorful pizza.\n",
      "Very nice digs. The decor is very nice with dark wood, burgundy drapes, white table cloths. Wait staff was very good and efficient. Waitress had good recommendations and knowledgeable about the menu and wines. \n",

      "Went for a family birthday celebration, our waitress over heard and made sure the birthday person received a desert with candle. Nice touch! \n",
      "\n",
      "Food was very good. For starters, the Carpaccio was Oh So GOOD! Others enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and Calamari. Some had salads and were very satisfied; I saved room for desert and skipped this option. Had the Lamb Chops, double cut, that were perfectly cooked, so tasty, and came with some really good thin onion strings and Bordelaise sauce. We shared some asparagus with Bearnaise. The asparagus was cooked perfectly; good with or without the Bearnaise.\n",

      "Was looking forward to trying Patron's Mex Grill, Authentic Mexican states the sign.  Like to try Mexican restaurants and wanted to compare to some little Taco shops that I have tried.  Patron's is more of a full menu restaurant, with a Bar at the far end of the building, not a Taco Shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patron's booths and walls all have some bright colors and there are a few Mexican paintings.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Service was good and fast.  Immediately received some fresh chips and salsa that was a little hotter than most Mexican places, very enjoyable.  Ordered a chicken burrito that comes with rice and refried beans.   Unfortunately, the rice tasted like it had been in a steamer a little to long and the chicken burrito was not very flavorful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant has a TV with a spanish station playing but the sound was not on.  However some music was being played in the restaurant, a little to load, but to make matters worse, the kitchen was blasting a radio and it interfered with the restaurant music and our conversation.\n",
      "Las Palmas #2 is in front of the Oakland Las Palmas mexican market.  Not sure how long Las Palmas has been making tacos in front of this market (was told on Friday thru Sunday only).  Similar to the Brookline location, tacos made on the street in front of the market.  So YUM!  The Pitt students are loving it.  $2 taco with corn tortillas.  Appears to be the same selection of meats and salsa's and toppings as the original.  Ordered two tacos, a carne asada and  a pollo.  The carne asada was just coming off the grill and was delicious.  The pollo was in a warmer and was a little tough and probably in the warmer to long.  The salsa's are great!\n",

      "Had another superb meal at Altius.  \n",

      "The flavored popcorn starter was fun.  The Imported Burrata with peaches was perfect.  My Lamb Rack was cooked perfectly and came with a wonderful combination of succotash and tomato with a very nice cream.  SWMBO had the Pork Chop that was very good and the left overs were great the next day.  For desert we split the Millionaire Bar that is a shortbread cookie dough with a wonderful dark chocolate and vanilla bean ganache.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Purrrrfect Sub\".  Nice slogan; and the hoagie sub was really good.  Also, the \"soon to be famous\" homemade potato chips were top notch.\n",

      "On TV there is Flip UR House.  This is Flip UR Restaurant.   Mexican now but it was Korean not to long ago.   Not sure, but I think our waiter said the owner had another Mexican restaurant but lost his lease and was happy to find this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was very good and friendly.  Two waiters served us.   Good on refills including the chips and salsa.   The chips were warm and fresh.  The Salsa relatively spicy.   The food and menu were somewhat similar to other Mexican places.  The guacamole was pretty good.  The relleno and chalupa were a hit. The beef burrito was just OK.  The beef tasted as if it had been in a warmer for a long period of time and just not that good.\n",

      "Don Jose has beer and Margarita's.\n",

      "It has been a while and we ordered a whole pizza via phone.  Told 45 to 60 minutes.  Arrived at 60 minutes and was told in a nasty tone that is was 45 to 60 minutes and our pizza would be at least 15 more minutes....was not even made yet....ummmmmmm!!!!!  OK, just be nice. No reason to be mean.  There seemed to be a large staff with two guys making pizza and some delivery, but I guess they were busier than it looked during my wait. \n",
      "The pizza was OK, the sauce and cheese were good but the crust was very dry and hard...so many pizza places to go back to...probably not here for awhile!\n",

      "Everyone really enjoyed their meal.\n",
      "We shared a couple of the sides.  Brussel sprouts and asparagus were good but not as good as mine.  The Lobster Mac was a big hit.  Some nice pieces of lobster were evident.\n",
      "For desert we shared a couple including the Passion Fruit rose Icebox Pie and the Steaming Chocolate latte.  Really enjoyed the Passion Fruit.  The Steaming Chocolate is definitely a chocolate lovers dream.  \n",
      "When we arrived the hostess made sure to congratulate the person who we were celebrating but was surprised they were not offered or given a small desert or something as does another restaurant just down the street always does.\n",
      "Tried the pizza and it was typical pizza, not to thick crust, good pepperoni, average sauce that was not very spicy.  This place also has a restaurant and next door a bar.\n",

      "Our service was very good.  \n",
      "We split a couple of pizza that were a little larger than we expected since my experience is that most woodfired pizza is on the smaller side.  Our waitress stated that the pizza is about medium in size and was correct.  The crust and San Marzano tomato with the pancetta, sopressata, and hand-pulled mozzarella was good.  There was suppose to be some basil on top, but it has forgotten.  The crust was cooked well and the pizza was soft to chew and tasty.  All in all, a pretty good pizza.  \n",

      "Have stopped by in the past for a cocktail/wine but never to eat.  \n",
      "Was looking for a place to have a late meal but not looking for anything to big, so the small plates and burgers seemed appealing.  While the menu is small it was difficult to pick between a burger and the pierogies.  Ordered a burger but will have to stop back for the pierogies sometime in the future.  My burger was one of the better you are going to get and the fries that came with were great.  \n",

      "Fresh ingredients and about 6 different salsa's that are labeled ( a real +).\n",
      "Had the carne asada, the chunks of meat were tough and overcooked, probably not a good choice since steak tacos at most places are tough and overcooked.  Also, had the carnitas taco which was very good, a much better choice.  \n",
      "Edgar seems to have some specials for the day but found the day I was there that the menu only had 4 taco meat choices and would prefer a another option.  There is the option for Tostadas, burritos and a few other Mexican selections.\n",

      "\n",
      "The menu has BBQ Chicken, Pork Shoulder, Brisket, St. Louis Ribs.  Sides of Corn Bread, Greens, Mac & Cheese, and Cole Slaw.    Drinks include Rock and Rye - drinks made with Old Overholt Rye,  XXX are other bourbons, Draft beer - 4 from East End, and Pop - including Cheerwine (a southern delicacy) Sprecher's Root Beer, Mexican Coke and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pork Shoulder was very tasty and it came with 2 small rolls.  Two sauces - a vinegar based hotter sauce with some hot peppers in the bottom of the bottle - very good and a sweeter sauce that was tomato based.  The sweet sauce was OK but I thought a little to sweet, but then again, I'm not a sweet sauce type.   The Mac & Cheese was good and it comes in a little bowl that is put in the oven/broiler so the top gets a little crusty.  Someone with us had the greens which have some bacon included and said they love the flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Type of place you should come with a group and try different meals so you really get the communal flavor.   The table behind us was doing that.  They knew someone in the kitchen that brought out a few samples of other food items to try.  Yum!\n",

      "\n",
      "PS:  It is a little dark inside at night.  The communal tables are unique because the set up like a typical BBQ place with picnic type tables, but the benches are set for  two/three  on a side,  3 if you are small per side, so you can have a 4 top and then there is space between the benches, so it is similar to many restaurants  with tables lined up along on side next to each other  with a little space between the benches but the table is connected, so you are not sitting directly next to someone you do not know.  So not really eating with everyone else, they are just next to you.\n",
      "Come and enjoy your meal and your company.  What a nice relaxing place!  Cool table painted by local artists, that you can buy.  Some other art work and including some glass art that is chunks of broken glass & cut glass on salvaged windows.  \n",
      "The menu has some simple yet contemporary cuisine that has some whimsical creations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We sampled the Saute of Chicken Apple Sausage and were not disappointed.  Very good!.  The Scallops Beurre Noisette on farfalle pasta was very tasty and perfect cooked.  The meal came with some bread with an orange butter that was so tasty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Our appetizer was brought out by someone else, who was not able to answer a question on the food and she did not try to find out.  We did ask our waitress later and received our answer.   \n",

      "Have been to Kaya many times and have always enjoyed our meals.  Surprised that I have not written a review until now. Have had many items on the menu including brunch.  We stopped in on a Thursday because one in our group really loves the Fried Chicken Thursday.  The chicken is really good and comes with a very tart slaw and it had a very good homemade ranch dipping sauce.  \n",
      "The drinks are good.  Our waiter was very good.  Refills when needed, helpful with the menu and with a nice personality!\n",
      "Great breakfast spot.  It is a small old place with friendly staff and newspaper ready to read if you are interested. My eggs were cooked perfectly, pancakes were large, thick and tasty.  The bacon and sausage were good.  Had the home fries which are like string potatoes that are put in a frier and watched the cook shred a potato to make the fries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Katana has 10% off in the first month (May).  Smaller than some of the others; 2 Hibachi tables, about 8 seats at the sushi bar and many tables in the back.  The sunshine coming in the front window was almost blinding.   The Sushi was not bad but mostly rice.   The miso soup and salad were the ordinary Japanese steakhouse soup and salad.  Liquor license application on the window.   Had an ice tea and they charged for a refill, come on!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good with 2 waitresses working together.\n",
      "Stopped in for dinner and sat at the bar.  Met a couple of people from out of town and had a good time with our new friends.  The atmosphere is the usual latest style of rough wood and a little dark.  Music was playing and it was to loud.\n",
      "The bar tenders were a little busy but seem to ignore us and the people next to us.  He had to flag them down for any request, found this strange.\n",
      "Ordered the Chorizo chili...No...We are out of that.  OK, back to the drawing board on what to order.  We decided to start with some chips and salsa.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa, not as salty as many places.\n",
      "Ordered the Cochinita Pibil and the Short Rib taco.  Both were very good but a bit on the small side, smallest I have seen at a restaurant or street stand.  The tacos were very good.  Liked both.  The short rib was my favorite.\n",
      "Nice little place for lunch.  It is a sit down restaurant, but noticed many that must have called ahead and ordered take-out.\n",
      "The meal was good, good price and a nice size.  A small salad came with the meal that had a ginger dressing and a mix of lettuce (not all head lettuce) and a small Egg Roll.  Had the Pad Thai that was good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A good place for a lunch in downtown.\n",
      "A nice new restaurant in the neighborhood with authentic mediterranean food.  we ordered at the counter and our food was then served to us.  A small dining area in the back and some tables in the front by the counter and display area.  Some of the food is similar to next door at The Simple Greek,which is good too.  \n",
      "My Beef and Lamb Shawarma was OK but the meat had little taste and was overcooked.  Simply a pita wrap with tomatoes, pickles, onions Tahini sauce with some lamb & beef.\n",
      "Awesome to have a french bakery in the neighborhood!  If your are someone who likes to eat French pastries and bread, LaG is great. I love almond croissant and LaG's didn't disappoint.  It has been hard to find a great croissant since return from NYC years ago, and now have the place to go.  The Lunette was excellent, too.\n",
      "Stopped by for a quick lunch.  Received the usual good Chipotle cafeteria style efficient service.  The food is typical and my burrito bowl was good.  This location is in a small area near the I79 interchange that is a little hard to get in and out of.\n",
      "Have heard some raves about this little Pasta and Panino place.  Final was able to give it a try.  The raves were correct.  A great little family style Italian restaurant that is not expensive with good food.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small menu but a half dozen specials on a little chalk board, that the Chef moved so we could read the specials.  Later the waitress, who was great, moved it so others could read it.  Some regulars came in and everyone got hugs! \n",
      "\n",
      "Was really thinking about the stuffed banana peppers or the lasagna, that our waitress said is one or her favorites.  Order a special of the day of linguine con shrimp in red sauce.  The red sauce was very good, nice flavors, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.   Was told the meat balls were good, but did not get a chance to taste because they disappeared so fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "During our meal, the Chef came over to check on us and see how the meal was.   Later he came back just to chat for a minute or so.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Noticed on the menu there are few things in larger quantities to take home including red sauce and beans & greens,   Next time I'm making spaghetti, I may just buy Mateo's sauce instead of making my own. \n",

      "The maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good at making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!\n",
      "\n",
      "Server also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  \n",

      "The meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  \n",

      "What a great experience!\n",
      "Nice place for lunch.  Service was good.  After we finished our plate someone was by to take it so we could get a clean plate for our next round.  Many have describe the food that is available but you do have to walk the whole line to figure out what you want to try.  Lot of Asian and Sushi, Salad Bar, Soups.  Tried some of the Asian and found most to be hot and OK.  Tried a couple of types of chicken and shrimp and the chicken was not so good, a little on the tough side while most of the shrimp was good except the coconut that was overly breaded and covered with a overly sweet sauce.  The Sushi was good.  Many different kinds and not to bad but the spicy tuna needed a little more spice and tuna.  Did not get to the desert bar but many did and it looked pretty interesting.\n",
      "Having stopped in a couple of times, I have found Andy's to be a fun place for a glass of wine.  Have never had any of the food or a mixed drink.  Usually sat at the bar and the bartenders have been very friendly and gave good service.  One of the things that I would like to do is stop in when there is some jazz.  Have never been there when the music is playing.  I find that was easy to get to know others, just seems to be a place that you can talk with the others near you if you want to.  Also met a couple of townies (a couple of couples that live downtown), that stop in once in a while for some wine and to meet friends.  \n",
      "As a few others have said, it really is next to the lobby of the hotel and has a somewhat cold chic decor.  The wine selection is OK but again, a little on the expensive side for the wines you get.\n",
      "Plan on stopping back during the days/hours when the jazz is playing.\n",
      "Friday Lent food option.  Fish or crab sammie at PennAVFish, offering good service with the best and freshest seafood available.  \n",
      "Some good soup options.  Just order at the counter and wait for the scrumptious sammie, grab a drink out of the cooler and if you want some soup help yourself.  Sammie came with some slaw and a bean and green pepper salad that was delish.   Sushi available, too.\n",

      "I hear it is a great breakfast, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looked at the menu on the chalkboard above the counter and notice that the specials and soups were only on the little sign out front.  So I asked and found that one of my fave's hot butternut squash soup was available.  It was so cold and the hot soup was delicious.  The Cuban sandwich went perfectly with the soup. The cookies and salads looked great, next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a great alternative Downtown.\n",
      "Friendly service.  Nice little place with wood panel on the walls.  Enjoyed a variety of things including the Mazza Platter.  The mummus, tabbouli were good but the baba ghannouj just tasted like smoke.  The Gyro was good, thicker cuts of meat instead of the thin sliced.  The meal took a little longer than we expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is BYOB, did not bring any in but the menu said, \"BYOB $10 per bottle.\"  WOW is that expensive!  Do not understand charging that much.  Did notice a liquor license application in the window.\n",
      "Great new location.  Bar in the center.  Place looks great!  Had to have the chips and salsa that are so tasty.  Had chicken tacos that come with spicy cabbage slaw and slice avocado. Yum.  Another success story from Big Burrito Group.\n",
      "It has been a long time since the first Italian Oven opened and they were showing up all over the area with the black and white tiled floors.  They were inexpensive, popular and had decent food.   But then there were problems and they closed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if this Italian Oven is owned by the same family but the decor is nicer than the IOR's of the past.  Walk in and there is a desert display and the deserts look delicious.  Was immediately seated and our waitress was great.  Refills without asking or even noticing, stopped and asked at the correct time without interrupting our conversation.  There is wine available but did not sample.  Did not notice if IOR serves beer but would think with wine there must be beer available\n",
      "\n",
      "Was not real hungry and tried a little pizza that is cooked in a brick oven.  The crust is thin and crisp like most brick oven pizza, the sauce is sweet so it should be a big seller in these parts since Fiori's is similar and popular.  Was not real hungry and the pizza filled me up so did not get a chance to try the deserts.  They menu has pasta, salads and panini's.  The pasta dishes looked to be popular, at many tables surrounding us.\n",
      "Have been wanting to try for a long time.  Stopped by with a few friends and really enjoyed our food.  I had the Berkshire Prosciutto that was very tasty - the salty meat with the nutty Parmigiano-Reffiano and the arugula was a well balance pizza.  The ingredients are fresh and high quality.  Service was relatively fast and so was our waiter.  He was really busy and made sure we had refills.  Had a glass of Italian wine that was a good match with my pizza.  As others have mentioned the pizza and wine are a little on the expensive side but you do get a quality product. Wish there was a little more to chose from like at C.Bella, that is similar but a little better and a larger selection. \n",
      "The menu is short with about 8 pizzas a soup, a salad and about 2 apps.  I did see a desert but we were to full to think of a desert.\n",
      "Was at Nova Place and found out Evil Swine was set up.  Was told they are usually there on Wednesday.  It must be a hit because the line was a little long but worth it.  Even though the food came out fast we were in line for about 30 minutes.\n",
      "Before we got to order they erased the chicken off of the white board menu.  \n",
      "Had the pulled pork with cheddar and slaw with a side of Mac & Cheese.  The pulled pork was very good...nice flavor with a little of the bbq smoke flavor and tender.  The Mac was very good and it seemed to have just a tad of red pepper to give it a little heat to go with a creamy cheese.   There  are two bottles with sauce, a Alabama white that is very good with some spice and a red.  \n",
      "If you are in the area, stop and try it out.\n",
      "You go for the soup!  \n",
      "But you enjoy many other items.\n",
      "Good homemade soup, my associate said.  \n",
      "They specialize in home cooked comfort food with a twist.  \n",
      "Meet me for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spicy tortilla soup was Oh So Good.  Nice spicy flavors with chicken, onions, green peppers slices and other veggies. \n",
      "The Crab Cake Sliders were very good.  A sauteed crab cake come on a mini salted pretzel bun with some tasty chipotle mayo, bib lettuce and a couple of slices of tomato.  The crab was jumbo lumped crab and did not have any filler :)!   Was very tasty!\n",
      "\n",
      "The wait staff was very friendly and busy.  Handling refills and checking on any requests.  \n",

      "The restaurant is in on old house that has been a few different restaurants.  The room has been painted a few bright colors along with some wide blue strips.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hostess stopped by a few times.  Finally, asked if she was an owner.  She introduced herself as Penny, a partner, who had a Southside restaurant.  The chef is from the same Southside restaurant and has won awards for his soups.   Learned that CP is making food from scratch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to really enjoy what they do!\n",
      "1905 is one of those restaurants that offers good food and friendly service.  On our recent visit I had the Crab ravioli with some veggies; think it was a daily special.  While I enjoyed the ravioli it seemed to just be OK, I guess I was expecting more flavor.  The meal came with a tossed salad and some fresh bread.    \n",
      "1905 is small and noisy.  There was a table of 12 that was very noisy.\n",
      "After a drop off college kid to apartment, he said that a new BBQ joint opened a couple of blocks away.  Let's try it.  So we wander over and it is Meat Here.  Having just tried the truck, I was game.  \n",
      "The Menu has BBQ and Mediterranean (see attached).  There a lot of tables but we were getting take out.  Noticed someone had a YinzBurgh BBQ T-shirt on and asked if they were connected.  Was told that they are but did not get a full explanation.  \n",
      "My ribs were definitely smoked and very tender and good.  Ordered a Kansas City type sauce...they have a couple of others - mustard based and vinegar based.  With my plate I could get one side and  selected the Hush Puppies, a true southern comfort food.  The Hush Puppies  were OK, a little overcooked but enjoyable.  \n",
      "All in all a nice place for BBQ.  Will have to stop back and try the Mediterranean.\n",
      "Pretty tasty pizza.\n",
      "Liked the tomato sauce, better than some of the more popular places nearby. Darren is correct TKO for sure!\n",
      "Crust is thinner and crispy.  \n",
      "Tasty pepperoni.\n",

      "Pizza with a purpose!   \n",
      "\n",
      "Have been to the other location and now to this location.  Delicious Flatbread Pizza, salads, breakfast panini and Wood-fired wings.  You can be creative and create your own pizza or sandwich.  Had the Capocollo flatbread sandwich with lettuce tomato cheese and fire roasted onions and the dry-rubbed wings.  Delicious!\n",
      "Wings and Suds!  Great place for a few beers and a snack or quick meal.  \n",
      "The Wings were rated the best in the Burgh by the City Paper (last year).  \n",

      "\n",
      "The menu has about two dozen types of wing sauces.  The medium wings we ordered were meatier than most other places and nicely cooked.  Good sauce, too!  Partner had a burger and said it was very good.  The menu has some other items but did not really look for anything but the wings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was friendly and good.\n",
      "Nice decor.  Good prompt service.  Had a crab salad wrap that came with crisp french fries and a couple of fresh strawberries.  Enjoyed the crab wrap.\n",

      "They use fresh farmed veggies from the Bitter Ends Garden. \n",
      "Small menu with 3 sandwiches, some pastries, bread, and dessert.  The menu today had a beet sandwich, a veggie hoagie and a egg with spinach and you could add lamb sausage on the menu along with a couple types of scones and a pumpkin desert.  Only about 10 seats and a church bench; the same as DJ's.\n",

      "The waffle cone was perfect...some crispness and a great texture...not to hard like most shops. \n",
      "Had the sweet ricotta with pistachio and cherries.\n",
      "Wow, how disappointing.  From the IO family and not up to their other restaurants standards.  We had 4 Tacos.  All were hardly warm, how about warming the meat, and lacking taste.  The health department may have a field day if the temperature of the meat in the warmers was checked.  The Red Chile Chicken taco meat was hardly warm overly moist and mushy. The Carnitas was OK but the Jalapeños made it not the meat.  The Carne Asada was just so meh and had to much cheddar.  Do yourself a favor go the Las Palmas or B's which are not to far away..\n",
      "Nice inviting atmosphere for a casual restaurant and bar.  Walk into the relatively large bar with mucho TV's.  A small dining area in front and a large dining area behind the bar.  About a dozen drafts on tap and more wines by the glass.  This is part of the Walnut Grove group.  The menu is similar (I think), but have not been to any of the others. The menu for lunch had many choices and it looks like you can create your own salad but my server was new, was not sure and did go and check on that.   Many different topping and dressings are available for you salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the WG\"s Crab Cake which seemed to need a little seasoning.   The crab cake was a good size with plenty of crab meat.  My associate had the Roasted Beet Salad.   Was able to get a bite because it was huge.  Tasty roasted beets with caramelized walnuts, gorgonzola with a herb balsamic vinaigrette,  The beets were good with the gorgonzola, but the caramelized walnuts  were a little to sweet and stuck to my teeth.\n",
      "Update due to recent visit and not much has changed.  Food started with heated chips and salsa that was OK. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food your get.  Had a combo of taco and enchilada with refried beans.  The choice of meat was limited and ordered the beef which was very plain, lacking much taste.  The refried beens were OK.\n",
      "Nice little Hot Dog - Burger Joint.  Great place to take your dad for a meal!\n",
      "\n",
      "Large selection of beers. The dogs are a good and snap to your bite.  My fav is the Chicago dog with the sport pepper and celery salt.  The snacks include some big onion rigs that come with a tasty spicy sauce and Pub Chips with your choice of seasoning.  The menu does have sandwiches, salads, wings and pizza.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Very friendly and attentive service.\n",
      "If you are in the area, this is a good quick stop.  It is a drive-in with some picnic tables that were all in use on our visit.  The menu has dogs, kielbasa, burgers and a few other options along with a great hand dipped ice cream milkshake.  I just had Jim's special dog.  The dogs are good and the sauce and cheese added a great flavor. The dogs are grilled then put in a broiler to toast the cheese.  The sauce is a little sweet, smoky with a little spiciness.  \n",
      "The sauce is also sold in bottles.\n",
      "The strawberry shake was thick with a lot of strawberry flavor came with some whipped cream and a cherry on top.\n",
      "So if you are in the area looking for a good dog or burger or sandwich, stop by and indulge.\n",
      "U know, I think I like it better for lunch.  An associate set up a little business lunch and brought some wine, too!  The restaurant was not very busy, so it was quiet.  A good place for a business lunch.  Service was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch menu has a couple of apps., salads, homemade soup, and about 10 sandwiches some pasta and desert.  The Manhattan Calm Chowder was good.  The Italian Calamari PO-Boy was really good.  The calamari was lightly breaded, topped with arugula, some cherry tomato, and spicy aioli.  The calamari was cooked perfectly, tender and very tasty with the spicy aioli.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We split a Arpino Cannoli which is two pizzelles with cannoli cream and chocolate sauce.  Delicious!\n",
      "The best salad I have had in a loooonnnggg time!  \n",
      "Another Hello Bistro and in a great spot downtown.\n",
      "You can build your own salad or pick one of the many on the menu.  I opted for the Caribbean Shrimp Salad that had lots of fresh greens, some marinated shrimp, avocado, black beans, corn, tortilla strips that added a nice crunch and a very good citrus lime vinaigrette.  \n",
      "Don't forget the fresh cut french fries.  Oh So Good!\n",
      "Some great Boylan's Red Root Beer, too.\n",
      "Nice greeting by the guy behind the counter.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Nice crust, flat pizza not NY style and not Chicago style.  The crust was nice and crisp and crunched when eaten, very enjoyable.  The sauce was very good and had a little more spice than many places, oregano?  Topped with thins spicy pepperoni which was good.  The cheese was good but a little greasy.\n",
      "Nice new location.  Have never eaten a PS sub so when this location opened near my work decided to give it a try.  Staff was friendly, especially a nice women that seemed to enjoy her work.  I thought the price was very reasonable. You can order a 6, 8, 10 or 12 inch sub.  The fresh cut fries are cooked in peanut oil.  Drinks include fresh made lemonade, fresh brewed tea and Pepsi products.  \n",
      "My Italian sub was very good.  Had the meat grilled and then it is put thru a little oven to melt the cheese. The Italian had ham, hard salami, pepperoni, provolone and was topped with lettuce tomatoes, red onion and banana peppers.  At the end of the sub assembly they put on vinegar, salt & pepper, oregano and mayo.  The meat tasted good and looked to be fresh.  Probably had a tad to much oregano for my tastes but not overwhelming; next time will probably ask to limit or hold the oregano.  My side order of fries were very good.\n",
      "New little BBQ place opened in Bellevue.  \n",
      "The menu has Ribs, Chicken, Pulled Pork and Shredded Beef and a few sandwiches and a salad.  Many sides and five or six sauces.  \n",
      "Had a plate of ribs that were nicely smoked, tender and easy to eat off the bone. \n",
      "Ordered the mild sauce since we were told the Jorge (hot) sauce was very hot.  Ended up getting the hot sauce or the mild is very hot.  The sauce was OK, but hot and had a vinegar flavor. Had a side of Mac N Cheese (which was OK, nothing special), and cornbread.  \n",

      "Stopped in for a snack/drink and to watch the Steeler game.  Not real busy but there were a couple of vocal fans having fun.  We started with the Malanga Fritter that had some Jalapeño.  The fritters were good with the jalapeño flavor and disappeared fast.  We then tried some empanadas- I tasted the Jamaican steak and another meat empanada.  Both were very good.  Looking forward to stopping back and trying some of the Caribbean items on the menu.\n",
      "Nobby's has opened up a second location. This use to be another pizza shop.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza is a thinner crisp crust with a sweet sauce, so it should be popular, since sweet sauce seems to be popular in the area.  Actually, to sweet for my tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a take out only location.\n",
      "Another from the local group.  Recently opened with two dining areas and a large bar.  The bar is large and has about 10 TV's. 30 beers on tap.  Looks like a good bar to go to with a group.\n",
      "Ordered from the lunch entrees.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken & Gnocchi that has a tomato basil sauce with some chopped tomatoes.  The chicken was good, cooked just right with some nice taste of the Parmesan.  \n",
      "Waitress was good.  The place was not real busy since it just opened recently.\n",
      "First time to Peppi's.  Hard to believe after all these years that I have never been to a Peppi's.  Read the menu on the counter because the chalkboard is confusing; even the staff said so!  \n",
      "You order at the counter and they delivered to your table.  It did take a little longer than we expected but not to long.  Enjoyed looking at all the photos while we were waiting.  \n",
      "Ordered the Franco, an Italian with a little extra salami.  Probably did not need the extra but the sub was very tasty and to large to finish, so I have lunch for today too.  While not the best Italian sub/hoagie that I have had, it was very good and better than most sub shops that have popped up everywhere.\n",
      "The staff was super friendly and thought busy did stop by our table.  If you are in the area and looking for a pretty good sub or sandwich, Peppi's is a good stop.\n",
      "Looking for a late night snack...actual dinner, too.\n",
      "Large place with a few tables and pizza by the slice.\n",
      "Not to many pizza by the slices were available.  Was talking with the staff about the pizza slices available.  Staff was very friendly...but not so informative...more later.  Ordered the pepperoni and sausage.   Forgot to ask if it is the sweet sausage or hotter...unfortunately it was really sweet...not the crappppy crumbled crap many Burg places use but this was a very sweet tasting almost like tasting perfume.  What a mistake. \n",
      "Took off the sausage but it still had the flavors...Oh Well, better ask next time. \n",
      "The crust seemed to be pretty good.\n",
      " \n",
      "Just as I took my first bite a delicious looking white pizza came out of the oven.  Now why oh why didn't they tell me that?????\n",
      "Wow, hit the spot ribs for a hungry crew.  The ribs are tasty, tender and moist and the sauce was good.  Had the sweet Sweet Potatoes and cheesy Mac & Cheese as sides...all very good.  The cornbread is some of the best I have every tasted...very moist and filling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was friendly and helpful.   If you are looking for a good rib dinner you won't be disappointed.  There are two small tables outside and a couple of tables inside...we did take out.\n",
      "Good pizza and wings.  Plenty of beer options.  Friday night, so it was packed.  A little noisy.  Staff was friendly and working hard.  There is a take out counter in the back that was busy.  Had the hot wings that were crisp and hot, hotter than most other hot wings we have had, but not to hot.  The pizza was good.  The crust is a little thicker but light and crisp.  We enjoyed the sauce and toppings.\n",
      "Good tacos.  Limited menu but so good.  Always seems to be busy.  The staff taking orders had to run to get some more food and so the cook was taking orders too.  Had the special of the day that was a Buffalo chicken with some peppers and I forget the other items.  Good taco but wish the chicken had a tad more flavor.  For my second taco ordered a carnitas that is one of my faves.  If you want a good taco at a reasonable price.  This is the place to go if you are in the area.\n",
      "Still not meatball's.  Service is friendly and did not take very long to get our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza is OK.  The crust was a little thicker than last time.  Just a reminder, the cheese is cooked on top of the toppings.\n",

      "\n",
      "We sat in the bar area that has 3 TV's over the bar and a TV beside the door for a table in the window.  Our server was good but seemed to always have to ask everyone a question when inputing the order in the system so there was some loud asking about type of sauce or bun or whatever across the bar and room. Must be a new wait person that hasn't figured out what is needed to complete the order when asking at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are about 20 beers on tap and pricing was good.  Ordered The Jabo which is Brisket topped with homemade macaroni and cheese and Jabo's signature BBQ sauce, on a fresh baked roll with a pickle spear and one side.  The sandwich was interesting. My brisket was mostly cold, thought it should be warmer and did not have much of the smoke BBQ flavor I expected.  The mac & cheese was OK, prefer it to be sharper cheese.  My side of baked beans was good and spicy.  As for the pickle spear..it did not appear and I just decided not to ask.  Looks like Jabo's has some service issues to work out but since they just recently opened will have to give them the benefit of being new.\n",
      "Reboot!\n",
      "Make way for a new menu.  \n",
      "Smaller menu and probably more to the tastes of what most in this area think of as Mexican food.\n",

      "Stopped by a couple of weeks ago and they had stopped making most items and only had some tacos, burritos and a few other simple items on the menu.  Was told to stop back in a few weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "The new menu seems to be shorter and has some interesting items.   Notice they still have the Sopa Azteca, really good last time but decided not to order since not real hungry.  Ordered the Lomitos Majahual, a marinated port in a red sauce served with rice, beens and a salad.  Received 3 tortillas, so you can stuff a tortilla or eat it off the plate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was hot and good.  The pork was 4 large chunks with a nice tasting red sauce.  One piece of the pork seemed to be overcooked, but the rest not. Not sure how that happens.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also get a beer or Margarita with your meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not busy but I still think later, when this place gets crowded, it will be hard to get the food out fast enough with so many tables.\n",
      "Good little diner.  Typical little diner except it is in a little strip mall next to the State Store...so kind of hard to find.  Must be Steeler fans...have a terrible towel and the bunny with an easter basket and Steeler gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Place was busy, good lunch crowd.  Have about 12 tables and a counter that is split with 4 and 4.  Sat at the counter to watch the cook.  Love to watch the cooks work!  If you order the pancakes, watch out, they are huge...you get two huge pancakes on a large oval plate...and yes...the plates do not match...so cool! \n",
      "\n",
      "For those more adventurous you can get the Country Fried Steak!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the Eggs-R-US' Almost Famous Breakfast Sandwich comes on Italian Bread toasted on the grill with melted cheese, a couple of huge thick yummy pieces of bacon (or ham or sausage), a huge scrambled egg.  OH SO GOOD!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh Yea, the home fries are good too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait staff kept my cup full and were friendly but very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a good breakfast give it a try...preferred over the infamous P's.\n",
      "Good place for a quick drink.  Met a friend for a quick drink.  Place is nice and relatively large.   Had the jumbo lump crab cake appetizer with a red onion caper sauce that was very good.\n",
      "Fun place for a group.  Stopped to watch some football and fill the belly.\n",
      "Couldn't wait to get the Brisket Sandwich.  Oh, not available till after 4...eh on a weekend with people watching football...how come so late.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Asked if any beer specials.  No!  How come, everyone else on Carson St. have beer specials during the game...just left a place with a special.  Proceed to order and when we were almost done the waitress said do you want that or the all U can eat, it is less $'s and more to eat.  If you have it a special, why not tell us before we order?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the ribs and nachos and corn bread were enjoyable.\n",
      "Great place for lunch.  Little place with a few tables and your meal comes in a little lunch pail.  The menu has some interesting choices and with homemade soup, creative sandwiches and wraps and a couple of salads.  There were some interesting items that your don't see in most deli's, BG is more of a fusion type deli.  In the case there were many creative and interesting items including a beet salad, meat loaf.  I kept it simple with the Smoked salmon BLT that had avocado and a grilled onion marmalade.  Sandwiches come with a nice green salad or some very tasty potatoes.\n",
      "Really like this place.  Stopped in for a quick lunch.  We sat at the bar and service was great.  They were doing some work to some of the tanks behind us.  The place is small and the outside area is completely closed with some overhead heaters.  The menu is a little different than my last visit.  Ordered the Sausage pizza that has posted jalapeño, banana and green peppers with Parma Mild Italian Sausage that is cooked in a wood fired pizza oven.  The pizza was very good with a spiciness from the peppers.  The crust is a little thicker, not paper thin and very tasty.  Great with one of their beers.\n",
      "A fine cooked on a grill snappy dog.  A good tasting dog, with natural casing that snaps when you bite into it, that is grilled with they have the usual condiments.  Love the long sliced pickle on top.  \n",

      "If you are not in the mood for a dog, step to the back and get a really good Italian hoagie.  \n",

      "Dogs in the front...hoagies in the back.\n",
      "What a nice place!  Looks to be great for a date.  Nice decor, dark with nice background music...soccer on the TV in the bar.  White tablecloths.  Enjoyable food and staff.  \n",

      "Forgot to check out the hours but just check the website.\n",
      "Little Mexican place run by some nice Mexican nationals.  Very friendly and good service. Food is authentic.  Small with only 9 tables and most only seat 2 people.  Place was crowded.  Some chips and salsa arrived immediately and they were good.  Had a Eggs and Chorizo Burrito,  the tortilla shell was good with a nice soft texture but the chorizo with egg had an odd taste..not a chorizo taste.  Guess I should have tried something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh the name is actually Mendoza Express, not sure why Yelp has Mendoza Abraham.  Added website and set note to Yelp about incorrect name, hopefully it will be changed.\n",
      "Was in a hurry and the line was short so decided to give WoL another try.  I guess I should have tried something else.  The Chicken and Cilantro Dumplings were good. The Spicy Chicken Fried Rice was not.  Should have just moved on.\n",
      "Mad Mex Lakeside just opened up in a location overlooking Canonsburg Lake.  Great place on the deck for a drink and a few apps.  Stopped in to try this location after golfing nearby.

      "We have been to WR a few times in the last year and have not been disappointed.  A few of the tables in the larger room seem to get more noise from the other tables so it can seem load but we have been in the other room or at a table at the end of the room and the noise level was not load. We started with the Charcuterie that was very good.  The menu does change somewhat each season but there are a few items that are almost always on the menu.\n",
      "On this visit I had the Beef w.Crabbie Cake, a 8oz filet and 4oz jumbo lump crab with no filling.  It had a trio of sauces, red wine, remoulade and horseradish cream.  Cooked perfectly and one of the better filets and crab cakes.  One wish is that the horseradish cream had just a tad more horseradish, but that is my thing.\n",
      "Tasted some of the Pork Chop that is grilled and comes with brussels sprouts and some brown sugar bacon chips. It was the perfect chop! So tasty!\n",
      "We did get a fresh salad with the meal that is good and only partially eaten due to the size of our meals.\n",
      "The do have a couple of deserts but we never seem to get one due to the fact that the diner plates are large, the hummus and crackers are so good and we had the Charcuterie app.\n",

Had the 8 oz burger which is really 2, 4 oz burgers with one stacked on top of the other.  The 2 stacked burgers were hard to eat because they keep sliding around and it was a big bite.  But I managed.\n",

The food at the other tables looked so good.  Our excellent waiter was able to describe and explain the ingredients and how everything is fresh.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The basket of bread with the seasoned whipped butter was great.  For \"Beginnings\" we ordered the Calamari which was very crispy and had a sharp spice edge.  For \"Main Events\" I had the Berkshire pork chop, basil spaetzle, grilled Treviso, peaches & hazelnuts.  The meal was wonderfully cooked and a great combo of flavors. \n",
      "For \"Sweet\" or desert we shared a desert that is two chocolate fudge rectangles on top of a chocolate cookie with homemade ice cream.  The fudge is so smooth and the the cookie is crispy.  But the ice cream was what we liked the most.  \n",

      "The tacos are an assortment of different flavors and not your normal taco.  Tried a BBQ Shrimp taco with chipotle and some avocado cream that was OK, the avocado cream was almost none existent. Also, had a Roasted Lamb Chili Verde that had a lot of flavor and received a fork full of the Salmon that was pretty good.  The tacos were on a flour tortillas which I was not expecting.  Would have definitely preferred it to be on a corn tortilla.\n",

      "Great view and deck in warm weather. Waitress was very friendly and quickly took order but the kitchen took forever, not sure why because it was not crowded.  Then waitress disappeared and could not get check at end of meal.  Has variety of flatbreads, sandwiches and dinner meals.  Carry good meats form parma sausage for the italian sandwich.  Pasta was nice but not inspiring.\n",
      "So LeBron James calls this his favorite pizza. It is similar to BAKD pizza, Subway, Chipotle being a cafeteria style (assembly-style). Pick a Signature pizza or build your own.  Interesting to see the pizza press that presses the dough.  It is cooked for 180 seconds. Had a spicy red with pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers, pesto finish.  A thin crispy crust was good, not soft in the middle and not doughy.  The sausage is a sweet style & not my favorite but still a pretty good pizza that did not take to long for a fast lunch.\n",
      "Get in line for the tacos.  $2 tacos that are the best.. just get in a long line to order and plenty of fresh made salsa's and condiments.  Does not take long and the smells are oh so good, makes you mouth water.\n",

      "Nice little place for a drink and some pretty good food.  The bar has a pinball machine in the corner, my memory may be incorrect but I think it was a Ghostbuster machine.  Did not play it. A comfortable dining area that was not real busy when we were there.  Started with the Ripe Tomato crostini that was very tasty with brie and a balsamic glaze.  I questioned, before ordering, if the tomato was ripe and not greenhouse tasting.  Our waitress assured me that it was ripe and tasty, she was not wrong, very good tomato along with tasty cheese and a wonderful balsamic glaze.  For the main course I had the Cricket-Chorizo taco.  The taco was OK but really lacked much flavor except for the cilantro, maybe I was expecting more.\n",

      "Started with the Tempura shrimp with vegetables accompanied by sweet and sour sauce.  Very average and no real veggies - just two lettuce leaves.  Ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree.  They ask how hot you want the sauce..from 1 to 10.  Had a 6 and it was plenty spicy with the ability to still taste the food.  The sauce was oh so good!  Made sure there was not any left on the plate...\n",
      "NaCl is unique different style restaurant.  A great addition the the food scene.  NaCL may not meet the high expectations of everyone and will not be liked by many due to the style of the restaurant and food.  A modern approach to design and food is sure to generate interest, great food and of course some interesting reviews.  Yes, it can be a little more expensive, too.\n",

      "\n",
      "Came late in the evening and it was not real crowded.  Love the fact you can get a meal late, when many restaurant are closing or just serving deserts and drinks.  We had the choice of a communal table, one was completely empty or one of the bars.  Chose the kitchen bar so we could watch the kitchen staff.  Love to watch them prepare the meals and cook; like watching an artist at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some innovative cocktails and nice wine choices.  I just had some wine but the cocktails received good reviews from the others.  Start - ordered the Tartare - truffle, brioche, pancetta, quail egg with whipped egg white was tasty and had a nice combination of flavors.  Main course, the Lamb with carrot, couscous, raisin, harissa was just perfect. \n",

      "Had the Fulton Street ribs, which were 1 lb. or a half rack, a long plate of ribs that they say are slow cooked then finished on a grill with a light glazed homemade BBQ sauce.  The ribs were tender and tasted very good.  I like the BBQ sauce, it was not to sweet and not spicy but added a nice flavor.  For a side I had the sweet potato fries, that were just not up to par.\n",

We went with a small group to celebrate too. It is a little on the noisy side so if you are a small group try to get the smaller side dining area.  \n",

      "If you are in a hurry this is not the place for you.   It has been years since I have been to LTI due to my last experience with a waiter but that is long gone.  Our waitress was good and had help delivering our food and picking up our dirty plates. \n",
      "Of course you have to share a couple of appetizers.  The beans and greens are you standard fare; nothing special but what you would expect.  The Calamari Frutti was very good.   For the main course I had the Tortelini with Crab and Shrimp with a spicy roasted red pepper cream sauce was a very good choice with enough left over for a good lunch.  For desert we were in the share mode and had a very good Cannoli and some really good spumoni covered in a chocolate crust. So if you are in the mode for a nice dinner and/or having a celebration this is a good choice.\n",
      "An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden, it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick, the sauce is tasty, cheese was nice... gummy, stringy, good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy, just right.\n",
      "New place in an old KFC.  Nice and clean with 3 booths and 4 tables.  Probably more of a take out place. The person taking the orders and delivering the food was very nice and friendly.  The menu lists it a #1 of 4 family locations in other Pittsburgh neighborhoods but the name did not come on up any searches, so probably have different names. \n",

Needed to ask for the check because they did not want to rush us out.\n",

We have had any number of the Starters, which are just OK, but then again it is a sports bar.  Have had a few different sandwiches and the When Pigs Fly was really tasty, with plenty of meat; could taste the different flavors of meat, egg and bacon.  The fries are not the crispy type so some will not like but others will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each visit our service has been good.\n",
      "All in all, have had good service and decent food.  Always wonder why people expect more from a sandwich/sports bar.\n",
      "What a great addition to the Strip.   If you like a wonderful flavorful tasty sandwich with fresh local ingredients, Thin Man is the place!  Friendly greeting when we entered. Like the chalkboard menu.  The Thin Man sandwich was so good, though probably not for everyone.  Tasty chicken liver mousse with a buttery and saltiness but not overpowering.  The sandwich also had some great bacon, onions and apples.  If you are not into chicken liver there are many other great choices.\n",
      "Have liked the pizza and wings...was hungry for an Italian hoagie.  Very good hoagie...not as good as my fav...but very good!  Very large hoagie! Very good price!\n",

      "Stopped in for dinner on Tuesday.  Wings are the special of the day $.30. So we tried a couple of wings.  We started with some homemade soup, Bean and ham, that was very good.  Then had some Hot Garlic Parm and some Honey Jalapeño.  Both were good, but we like the Hot Garlic Parm better.  Thought the Honey Jalapeño were a little to sweet.  \n",
      "The wait staff was super friendly and gave us a sample of the soup prior to ordering.  \n",
      "The have a list of the specials that don't seem to change, $30 wings on Tuesday, Monday there is another special and there is Karaoke and Trivia nights.  Would like to come back in the warmer weather and try out the deck.\n",

This store has a Starbuck, sushi, a cafe, a deli, a bakery, a mix and match veggie area, a pharmacy, coke machine with hundreds of flavors (like this!) soup and salad, Frozen Yogurt bar, fresh produce, and lots more. It is more a tiny GE Market District with more foodie/uniques and specialty grocery items.  You can get wine and beer by the glass in the cafe or take a growler or six pack (looked like over 100 varieties) with you.    We stopped in for some coffee and some sweets and ended up with that and a breakfast burrito and some sushi to go for lunch..\n",

      "This is a nice bar with about 12 craft beers on tap and lots more in bottles - I think they do growlers.  Had to try the wings and ordered Buffalo.   The wings were crispy but needed a little more buffalo heat.  The blue cheese dressing was ranch with crumbled blue cheese on top, not the way I prefer.\n",

      "Lots of TV's to watch if you are interested.  Was told that Wednesday's is comedy night.\n",
      "Like the idea of fill out your own sheet to Build Your Own Taco.  They have a variety of taco shells but not the softer corn shell that most real Mexican places have, Wish they did.  It took us awhile to figure out what options we wanted on our Tacos.  Had some chips and gauc. The gauc. was a little on the sour side but still enjoyed it.  I had two tacos, one with the hard corn tortilla with chorizo and some other toppings and a flour with shrimp ceviche and some toppings.  Really enjoyed both.  Both had some nice flavors and little kick to them.  Of course your salsa and sauces options can really heat things up, but I stuck to some of the milder/medium options.  Our orders came out pretty quickly.  The system they have seems to work well. The tacos are $3 but some of the add on items do have an UP Charge.  \n",
      "We sat at the upstairs bar and our bartender was great.  She was really busy since it was a very crowded and noisy place.  Drinks were good too.\n",

      "How about the price of the lunch special.  A half Sub, Fries and a Beverage for $7.99.  Perfect for me this day.  Had the Italian Sub.  It was good but not nearly as good as my FAVE.  The bread/bun was OK but again not as good as some from some of the local bakeries.  \n",
      "The service was super friendly and helpful!\n",
      "Welcome to the neighborhood!  What a nice addition..Potomac used to be lots of pizza (some not so good), a great bakery and one OK diner.  No longer, along with Sugar that is celebrating it's 1st anniversary, TSpoon is a welcome addition.  Yea!\n",

      "We shared the Salmon in Heaven and Green Curry with Shrimp.  Both were good.  The green curry was spiced just right with fresh veggies and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (nice and tender).  The Salmon in Heaven was a little better, again cooked just right.   The food was good, but maybe not quite as good as SBL or LBITS, Thai restaurants that are my favs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely return.  Welcome, Welcome to the neighborhood!\n",
      "Of course the vue is fantastic!  Our server was super friendly, maybe to much so.  Forgot to tell us the special until we asked after we ordered.  Order a bottle of wine, after 15 minutes asked our waitress about our wine.  The bartender was busy with 10 ladies at the bar, we were told.  Well why not get the manager to get our bottle requested?  When the wine came server poured way to much in our glasses.  Obviously server training needed.\n",
      "Started with the Bada Bing Shrimp,  a spicy sauce was OK but not anything special.  I had the Osso Bucco.... Very good!\n",
      "Waited for our salads, which are huge, wondering why other tables had bread & oil with sun dried tomato & tapenade but we did not.  Well it did come with the salad but others received it with app.  Not sure when it should have come but servers are not consistent or others requested it early. With our salad was OK by me.\n",
      "Did I mention the Osso Bucco was really good!  Had a bite of salmon & it was good too.  \n",
      "We had a nice diner with a great view.  Probably a 3.5 diner due to my Osso Bucco!\n",
      "Stopped in after that long, over 2 hour late Doctor appointment.  Was starving.\n",
      "Interesting new place with nice decor.  The line was not to long and was able to make a decision on my order fairly fast due to the menu on the wall.  The Piada is a custom rolled wrap that is heated on a stone grill.  The wrap was good and I think the cook put some EVO on it as it cooked.  You can also get a salad or some spaghetti noodles/bowl.  The food is prepared along an assembly line just like the auto industry, or Chipotle or Subway.  Anyway, I ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada with calamari.  The calamari was an extra $1.49 which is really reasonably price.  The calamari was a little tough and OK.  The wrap was stuffed with spicy diabolo sauce, romaine, sweet & spicy peppers, mozzarella, and creamy parmesan.  Will definitely try to return and try some other options if in the area.  \n",
      "The staff was friendly and did a good job of answering questions.\n",
      "Popular place.  We were told 25 minute wait and it was a few minutes less.\n",
      "It is a little loud. They seem to move tables fast.  Our waitress was OK.  She did explain one item when asked but just seemed to be in a hurry.  Our food did come out fast but not all together.  One person was done when the last meal come out.  I get that most share and we did share some items but the last meal received was for someone that was not sharing.  We were given some take away containers before being asked and before being done...I guess we were at the table to long! Ha!\n",
      "With so many reviews and pictures will keep this short.  The potstickers and Soup Dumplings we had were very good.  We had the drucken chicken to start and it was a little to cold from sitting in a cold refrig. We were there on a Sunday when they are suppose to have Shrimp w. Loofah Soup Dumplings but it was not available...we were there for an early dinner so not sure if it was available that day or not.  We had some steamed broccoli with the minced pork sauce that was cooked perfectly and very good.  I am a fan of the food but the rush to get you out and the lack of any real service was strange!  So do take out!\n",
      "One of the best Italian subs you can get!  \n",
      "\n",
      "After many years of having the TB&G on my list of must go to places, was able to stop by and get some take out.  Fun to watch the staff of about 4 making the sandwiches. Just get in line and order when it is your turn.  The 26 inch Italian was so tasty with lots of meat and the sweetness of the Italian dressing.   The place was jumping with people in line and all the tables and bar full of people eating one of the great sandwiches.\n",
      "Have visited twice in the last couple of weeks.\n",
      "First visit was for lunch and sat at the counter.  It was rather noisy but not to bad since I was by myself.  My waitress gave me good service but did not say anything and was busy.  The manager/owner did stop for a quick, \"How is everything\".  My Greek chicken panini was dried out tasteless chicken, a surprise since this place seems to get such good reviews.  The fries and cole slaw that came with are what you would expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to give it a try for breakfast.  We were expecting a wait and the hostess said 10 to 12 minutes.  We were surprised by her estimate.  Well 45 minutes later we were called and seated.  \n",
      "The place is so noisy we had a hard time talking/hearing each other.  Our waitress leaned way over the table to talk with us.  Did I mention it is way to noisy/load.  Our waitress was good and provided refills.\n",
      "I had the blueberry pancakes.  The fresh blueberries were good, the pancakes were large but just OK not sure how to describe but just OK, not as good as a couple of other little diners we usually go to.  Also, a little more expensive.  Others had the french toast and bacon and were happy with their meal.  I did get a couple pieces of their bacon because they received so many pieces -- and the bacon was really good, thick and cooked perfectly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Portions are large.  Service is good.  Food is OK, but nothing exceptional.\n",
      "Did I mention Very Noisy!\n",
      "While I enjoyed my meal, it probably deserves more than 3 stars, but not 4 stars, so 3 it is. Service was OK.  Staff was not friendly and on their phones way to much.  I had the Fat Doug Burger w/pastrami, swiss cheese, creamy coleslaw and some top notch stadium mustard...a good mustard that is hard to find in this area.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was very good, nice combo of flavors, good pastrami and swiss cheese.  Had a side of the Lola fries which were good but similar to many places with the rosemary seasoning.  It is a real good spot in the airport but again the competition in the airport is moot.\n",
      "Yay, another good Mexican taco shop!\n",
      "\n",
      "Small place with 2 table and 2 chairs at a counter.  sauces and sodas lined up at the counter so you can see what is available.   The service was friendly and they filled us in our some of the offerings and info on the owner/chef.  Found out it was the wife of the owner/chef, so it is a family affair.  She said, \"they have some specials on weekends including some Caribbean items\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Corn taco shells are delicious had about 6 options and we choose the Carnitas and the Jamaican Jerk.  Very good tacos filled with a large portion of meat, cilantro, onions, cheese, lettuce and they bring out 3 different types of salsa to add to your taco.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Jarritos Mexican soda is also available.\n",
      "Excellent Thai.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just opened this week so not real crowded, but it will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Started with some soup with scallions and rice, very good.  Ordered the Green Curry which is a curry paste with coconut milk, eggplant, bamboo shoots yellow peppers, and order it with shrimp (other options are pork, chicken, veggie..probably more).  All very fresh, tasty, cooked perfectly and delicious!   Spice is rated from 3 to 10.  Had it 6 (my usual) and it was very spicy and flavorful.  A ten must be unbelievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is small with a minimalist decor but nice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Chef, Penny, came out to greet the tables.  She gets most of the produce from the local markets and only cooks the food to order, so no precooked items.  Also, it is BYOB.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those that live downtown or in the Strip,  you have a new place U can walk to!\n",
      "Interesting decor.  Check out the pictures others have posted.\n",
      "This place is BYOB, which is nice.  We did lunch take out so not need for the BYOB.\n",
      "Service was very friendly and asked if we wanted some water while we waited since we did not call ahead.  It did not take to long.  The Pad Grapow with pork was very good.  Three spice levels and medium is pretty spicy.  A crispy roll came with.\n",
      "Spring is here.  All the BBQ places are open!  \n",
      "We stopped by on a warm night and eat at one of the picnic tables by the trailer and the large quantity of work stacked behind the tables.  We ordered the BBQ Egg Rolls with smoked chicken, not knowing what to expect.  We received two large rolls that were fried  & stuffed with smoked chicken.  While the chicken was tasty the roll/wrap was a little different but OK.  Actually enjoyed the chicken.  It comes with a white BBQ sauce that was OK.  Actually the regular BBQ sauce was probably better with it.  We also had the pick 2 meat dinner with Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Both meats were good with a little smoke flavor.  We had Mac n Cheese and Cole Slaw of the sides.  The Mac n Cheese was OK and the slaw was kind of meh.\n",
      "Stopped in to get a Steamie Sandwich.  Parker's steams all the sandwiches, which I have had in other cities but never have seen in PGH.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Parker's is open for breakfast, coffee and lunch/sammies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandwich menu is on a chalk board where you pick your bread (bagel, pretzel bun, sub roll) meat, cheese and condiments.  The sandwich is then steamed.  You get a nice warm steamed sandwich.  I had a meatball with pepperoni, provolone on a bagel with some banana peppers and onions.    Delicious!  Nice price too, $5. There were a couple of soups and a mac & cheese with bacon special.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Was told that all the bread, meat and coffee were bought from local PGH businesses.  Zeke Coffee, meat from Butcher on Butler and Strip District Meats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The space is in the old Dormont Dog's location, with about 6 counter seats and three small tables.\n",
      "Was told it is small.  Well it is tiny!   3 tables (give or take one) and about 12 seats at the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the waitress, cheerful and peppy!\n",
      "\n",
      "The burgers are fresh and large.  Had the Double Bleu with bacon.  Oh yes it was juicy..run down the arms juicy...but over cooked.   Fries are fresh cut and very good.  Good place for lunch and a burger... some nice beers and a few people stopped in for the Whiskey.  You can sit at the bar and watch the chef working hard, never standing still.  Man he works hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brick oven pizza looked delicious...next time!\n",
      "Two delicious tacos for $5.  Awesome!  Corn tortillas with your choice of the usual meats but also lengue (tongue).  Fish and shrimp tacos cost a little more.   Don't forget the great sauces -  the green is mild, one of the red sauces is very hot - just look for all the pepper seeds floating in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were making enchiladas that looked great.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Go inside and get some of the chips from their chip factory or take some tortillas home for a make it your way, since you can put almost anything delicious you want into a taco.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come eat tacos, Explore the store!\n",
      "The place was empty.  Stopped for late breakfast after early appointment.  Ordered the Acapulco omelette to go.  It was nice. Omelette had some chorizo sausage, avocado, onions in it.  Came with FW potatoes which are like home fries (which were OK) and some fresh fruit. Menu has some nice omelettes that a little different or you can create your own.  Menu has some heathy items on it.  Lunch menu looks nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "While you can get some different omelettes, have had the similar food at better price at eat n park and it comes with fresh fruit also.\n",
      "Good sandwiches! The menu is a smaller version of Brick N Mortar. Some Handhelds & Dogs. Stop by the Heidelberg food truck Friday. The Guido & torts were very good. Just like BnM.\n",
      "We were in a booth with the sun coming in blinding me.  The lower windows have blinds but not the top window....so no sun protection...get blinds for Pete's sake! \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter was also handling the bar so he was busy once people came in and sat at the bar.  Service was OK.  It did take a little longer than I would expect to get our meal after we ordered but we were not in a hurry and were there to dine.  \n",
      "Had a salad that was fresh and really good.  Ordered the short rib ravioli that came in a red sauce.  The ravioli was good and the red sauce was good too.  Since everyone has there idea of what red sauce should taste like, I found this to be good.  One person in our group had a pasta with the sausage and felt the same as I did on my previous visit...find a different sausage supplier!\n",
      "Stopped in to get a gyro.  Friendly service and somehow related to the location on 4th downtown.  The menu has some variety from Wraps & Gyro's to Pide (Turkish Pizza) to kebaps, to regular pizza, salads and wings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My gyro was good.  The fries were pretty good too.  Will have to stop back and try a Pide.  The person next to us had a Pide and said it was his favorite thing on the menu.\n",
      "Small little shop with one person handling the orders and cooking.  They were out of a couple of items so the small menu was more limited.  Had the Rueben.  Sat and watched as the meat and kraut were cooked.  Tasty sandwich.  Would not hesitate to come back.\n",
      "Really nice little place with white table clothes, a view of the small kitchen and a view out the window to Carson Street.  Only 8 tables and you come here to dine.  \n",
      "BYOB, so bring one of your favorite wines and enjoy with a delicious meal.  \n",
      "We started with some fresh cooked bread, the dough comes from Mancini's that's baked in house.  With the bread we received some olives, a dipping oil and Giada for a great start.   The menu has some interesting choices including a few specials of the day..a fresh sea bass, homemade ravioli and pasta.  The fresh pasta comes for Ohio City in the strip. We shared our meals and the paperdelle was a good choice.  The crab cakes were very good..a toasted red pepper aioli on top and some grilled veggies and potatoes on the side.  Almost forgot that we had mozzarella pomodoro for an antipasti; the mozzarella is made in house and is a great starter.  With our meal we had a choice of a house salad or soup.  I had the shrimp bisque and found it to be a little light on flavor.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was very good, helpful and friendly.  Be sure to make reservations as all the tables were full.  We did arrive about 15 minutes early and our table was still being used so we spent a  few minutes walking around the neighborhood and window shopping.\n",
      "Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.  \n",
      "The staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first.\n",
      "Another good Taco Stand connected to a little Mexican grocery.  The tacos were very good.  Had the chorizo and the al pastor.  Both very flavorful.  The toppings bar has cilantro, onion, peppers,  a tomato onion mix, a medium green salsa and a hot red salsa.  All of $2.50 each, pay inside before you order.  There are a few other types including chicken, carnitas and one or two more.  \n",
      "There are a couple of picnic tables for eating or you can take it with you.\n",
      "Its a cold and rainy night.  Looking for some hot food, a good source of energy say the Koreans.  You get it with some authentic Korean cooking with some hot, sweet, bitter and sour tastes in your meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The decor is  nice, a kind of modern/spartan with stainless steel tables. \n",
      "\n",
      "The kimchi was great, some nice spicy cabbage.  Received a few small nice servings of kimchi, fish steaks, marinated cucumbers, bean sprouts and more, Some sweet some spicy.  All very interesting and good.\n",
      "For my main course chose the Jeyuk Bokkeum, a stir-fired spicy pork and veggies, It was very tasty, spicy with some red pepper.  What a nice change of pace.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like Chinese or Thai food this is a nice alternative.\n",
      "Had a big fat Greek Gyro.  It was a big fat good greek gyro with the typical yogurty sauce, tomato, onion and lettuce.  New location.  Not crowded, staff was very nice.  Put PIta on the grill, once warm made the big fat Greek Gyro.  Had a spanakopita also.  They have soup, salad and a few other sandwiches, also have a few deserts including baklava.\n",
      "Stopped by for a quick lunch because I liked the place that use to be in this location.  This location has been a couple of pizza shops and a hot dog shop in between.  \n",
      "Anyway, there are specials going on for the opening.  We had a pizza with pepperoni.  The crust is medium in thickness and was well cooked and a little crunchy.  The sauce and cheese were good.  The people in the shop were very friendly.\n",
      "Panera does a nice job on some items.  Stopped to have lunch with a friend who wanted to use the WiFi and get a bite to eat.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of a soup type day, rainy and cool...so had a bowl of low fat veggie...very nice and a greek salad that is pretty good.  The best part was the fresh baked bread.\n",
      "Wingsday, how can you go wrong!  $.44 wings on Wednesday, so we had to stop by craving some good wings.  \n",
      "Tacos are $2.50 for those that don't like wings.  BT is a good neighborhood bar with friendly service and real good crispy wings.  A nice selection of beers on tap and about 20 wing flavors that are rated 1 to 5 on the menus heat index.  We had the BT Original and the Dingo.  Both were very good.  Neither are real hot or spicy but with a nice flavor and just a little kick.  If you like spicy you may want to go to the 3 or 4 on the heat index.\n",
      "I'm sure we will be back for Wingsday.\n",
      "Delicious fried wings.  Very good ribs.  The spicy sauce is spicy but not overly spicy.\n",
      "Cornbread muffins were oh so good!  The mac & cheese was pretty standard and OK.  The sweet potato casserole was to sweet for me but others liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was super nice and friendly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we have 2 good BBQ places in the neighborhood!  YEA!\n",
      "If your in the mood for some good Neapolitan Pizza from the brick oven...M's is a good place.  The pizza's are handmade with very tasty ingredients including San Marzano tomatoes.  The Margherita pizza did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crisp on the edges but soft in the middle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Why 3 stars.  The poor waitress, one, had a lot of tables and was falling behind but very mindful and stopped to check on us,   Finally, received some assistance from someone from the basement kitchen but it was just to slow.   The salads and Gelato looked great...so next time.\n",
      "Stopped by to get a couple of slices of pizza for lunch.  \n",
      "Jet's has 4 styles of pizza: Signature Deep Dish, Hand Tossed Round, Thin and NY style.\n",
      "By the slice, Jet's only has the Signature Deep Dish.  \n",
      "The menu has Wings, Salads, Jet's Boat  and Jetzee Subs.\n",
      "This location is only take out or delivery.  No tables and a rather small waiting area that was crowded.\n",
      "The pizza was pretty good.  Nice thick bread crust with a tomato sauce that was thick and probably a little to much on the pizza and mozzarella cheese that was good.\n",
      "Seated promptly and received bread and olive oil sun dried dip (promptly)..nice but the bread was nothing special, seemed day old.  Since this is an old long time place stuck to the basics and had the penne with marinara sauce..it was good.  Was able to have a few bits of the Fettuccine Alfredo which was nothing special.  \n",
      "\n",
      "BYOB was popular at many tables.\n",
      "Had lunch with some associates.  The atmosphere is very casual, as is the service.\n",
      "We all enjoyed our meals.  I had the Pastrami sandwich which states coleslaw, fries, aged provolone.  Well the fries and slaw come on the sandwich, I know many places do this but was not sure it would be on the sandwich probably should have asked.  Waffle chips came with the sandwich.  The sandwich was one of the better Pastrami sandwiches I have had.  The slaw was a red slaw and very mild. The fries and chips were very good and crisp.  The bread was heavily buttered and toasted which made for a very rich tasting sandwich.\n",
      "Was shopping for shoes and few other items with my teenage kids.  Guess what, teenagers  got hungry...they are always hungry..lol..and recommended a quick sub from JJ's.  While I have never been to a JJ's, the kids said it was OK and pretty fast.  So we stopped in and did receive our subs pretty fast.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the Italian Club.  It was good, with plenty of meat including some capcola, ham, salami and provolone cheese.  Wanted hot peppers, but forgot to ask.  \n",
      "We split a bag of chips that were very crunchy and more like kettle chips.  \n",
      "The kids were right, fast and a pretty good sub.\n",
      "Traveling around and it was getting late and the ole stomach was growling.  Remembered that PP was around the corner and we had a coupon.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped in and it felt like we were in the middle of the kitchen..funny little set up but OK with me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had a pizza that was good, the dough is semi-thick and tasted OK with the sauce and toppings but the outer crust was kind of blah!   Had some buffalo wings that were good.\n",
      "Camp's has a cult following.   As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult, so we go to Camp's from time to time.  It has been a real long time since our last visit so it was fun to stop back in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The crust is a medium thickness, not to thin and not to thick, and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit, I really don't get that, but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and will be back.  Have had the hoagie in the past and if I remember correctly, it is very good.\n",
      "The main reason you go is for the experience, to experience the place and the fun sandwich.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Having been to Primati's many times have learned to get some of the meats that have a little bit of zip/taste so ordered the capicolla, and the sandwich came out hot and the capicolla was very good.  The slaw had a tart taste and went well with the sandwich, my only grip is the fries, why are they so eh and so soft and mushy.  Yes the Italian bread was good and yes the sandwich got a little soggy and the bread started to get little hard to handle and break apart. But that is all part of a Fun Experience of Primanti's.\n",
      "Have been to this location before, not sure what happened to my previous review (go figure that Yelp changed or lost it), but so many call this Sienna Mercato or Sienna pgh due to the website; anyway it is one of the three restaurants in the Sienna Mercato building.  1. Emporio the Meatball Joint, 2. Mezzo (a pizza and charcuterie- wood-fired pizza-pasta- panini place) and 3. Il tetto (a beer garden) on the floor with an roof that open in good weather. Had the spicy pork meatballs which were good but nothing to write home about.  The do have a few options on the meatball choices including a vegetarian meatball...go figure.  We eat and were seated at the bar and the bartender was friendly and good.\n",
      "Nice place with an outdoor patio.  The sign said they have DJ on Friday and Saturday night.  14 draft beers.  Nice friendly staff.  Good Service.  \n",
      "The gyro was good.  Typical size and tasted good.  The fries were crispy and good once they were salted.\n",
      "Came with some friends.  Our food was good but a couple of people in our group said \"Don't think I would return.\"  \n",
      "Service pretty much SU_KED!\n",
      "Ordered the Ribs but then the waitress said they were out.  How can this place be out of ribs?  Why didn't the waitress say that when given the menu's or when first seated?  \n",
      "Ordered a snack and it came when we were almost done with our meal.  Why did it not come first as we requested?\n",
      "Wow, One of the best chicken and waffles I have ever consumed.  The chicken is big, delicious, moist, tender and flavorful.  There is syrup, hot sauce, jalapeño honey (nice), sriracha syrup and at least one more that you can put in a small cup for dipping or drenching.  \n",
      "You can find their location on the website.  The website also states that nothing is ever frozen and the chicken contains no added hormones, antibiotic or steroids.\n",
      "Neat little place for a sandwich or wings.   Had the wings...spiced whole wing that come in a brown paper bag if you get it to go.  Very good, very nice flavors and spice.  One/half of a sandwich that is Pittsburgh style is about 9 inches....Wow is it big!\n",
      "Stopped in for a quick B-fast to meet a friend who really liked the Crack'd Egg. \n",
      "Liked the service and friendliness of the staff.  \n",
      "The menu has some creative takes on some old standbys.  My Capri Benedict is two eggs on two thick sliced tomatoes with some Motz cheese, Hollandaise, and Balsamic Reduction and some great home fries.  Really a nice B-fast.\n",
      "Tandem is right on the Montour Trail at the bridge over Morganza Road.  Nice to have Tandem open up.  You can get some food & beverage.  We have stopped to get a beverage and some ice cream (Perry's).  Coffee, lattes, cookies and oatmeal available.  Roadside BBQ sandwiches are also available.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to rent a bike or are looking to buy a bike, Tandem has both.  Bike accessories on sale, too.\n",
      "Stopped in for a drink and dinner.  Service was OK but a little disinterested.  My dinner of Medium Rate Short Ribs was very tasty but some of the meat was very tough and so ended up with so much grizzle that had to put it on the plate.  Not sure what happened but most of the meat was really subpar.\n",
      "Nice new little classic sammich shop that cuts the meat fresh, bakes the bread, and cook their own roast beef.  In the next week or so there will be homemade soup.  The sammiches are topped \"Jersey Style' with lettuce, onion, tomato, vinegar, oil, salt and oregano, unless you request to not have the toppings.  You can add a few additional toppings such as slice pickle, peppers. There is a Veggie sammich on the menu but did not read what it would have on it. \n",
      "Had the Lebo with swiss, turkey, ham roast beef and bacon with some chips.  The sammich was very tasty.\n",
      "Will have to stop by and try a soup and sandwich.\n",
      "If you are looking for a small romantic dinner, Crested Duck may just be the place.  Small place that is nicely painted and intimate.  Bring along a good bottle of wine to go with the interesting and wonderful food.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You are dining tapas style, so it can be a little on the expensive side when done, but well worth it!  We tried the pate and meat charcuterie and a cheese plate.  The meats and pates were out of this world!  The cheeses were very good with some different styles.  You can't go wrong with Crispy Pork that comes with greens, tomato, and a honey vinaigrette or the Smoked Duck with cornbread, kohlrabi & radish slaw with a strawberry bbq sauce.  \n",

      "The pork ribs were tender and juicy and had the BBQ smoky flavor.  Really enjoyed the sauce, different then most others I have had.  I think just a hint of mustard but a variety of flavors.  The Mac & Cheese is OK.  Had the Baked Beans and they are terrific, Spicy, With Peppers.  Paid $1.00 for a piece of cornbread that was moist & pretty good.  \n",
      "Staff was friendly and helpful when asking about the sides.  \n",
      "We sat outside at a table. Luckily it was one of the last warm days of the year.\n",
      "Friendly staff, just two people working.  Given a small serving of nacho chips (offered more when empty) and salsa.  The salsa was a little spicier than most places and had a little sour flavor.  The menu is the usual standard Mexican.  Nice little place, could tell they had just cleaned, had that pine sol aroma.  The Chimichanga comes in a soft flour tortilla, chose to not have it fried, and  a guacamole salad and beans came with it.  Enjoyed the meal.\n",
      "Have been to the Dor-Stop a couple of times recently.  Able to get a table almost immediately.  One time I had the pancakes.  The pancakes are really good and actually more than I could eat; probably one of the better items on the menu.  Another time I had a eggs benedict special that was pretty good but the Hollandaise sauce is not that good just OK, probably not real fresh or comes out of a can. \n",
      "Both times are service was pretty good.  Our waitress was on top of it and friendly.\n",
      "Old Town Buffet is the new Misaka.  Not sure what has changed since I never made it to Misaka.   You get a big buffet with reasonable prices. Standard Chinese dishes, some typical buffet items and sushi rolls.  Not sure if related to Yu's Old Town Buffet in Pleasant Hills.\n",
      "Nice addition to the local restaurants.  The room is large and has black walls and ceiling with a long bar along the one wall.  It was busy.  The room is dark after sunset and many were using their phone flashlight to read the menu.  \n",
      "The wine list is really nice.  Some interesting selections both by the bottle and glass.  If you need assistance, someone can help you select.   \n",
      "We started with Grilled Whole Prawns with a beet root cocktail sauce.   The prawns were very good and the beet root sauce was oh so good.  For an entree I had the Smoked duck that was perfectly cooked.  The duck come with figs and haricots verts that were a great accompaniment.\n",
      "While service was pretty good, a little shaky at times.  Probably due to the recent opening and learning.  We were never offered any desert menu or desert option.\n",
      "Nice new Panera.  Very crowded Panera. Has an outdoor seating area. The indoor seating area is smaller than some of the others that I have visited.  Has a small gas fireplace  Good tomato soup and tuna sandwich.\n",
      "Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!\n",
      "Nice deli sandwiches.  Have been stopping by a few times this summer and you can't go wrong.  Great sandwiches with Boars Head meat and cheese and Mancini bread.  You can pick up some fresh made pies and deserts.  It can get a little crowded and only about six tables for 2 in the entrance area, but at this time of year I get take out and find a nice spot outside.  You can make your own or order some that are listed and named after some customers.\n",

      "Polishing her nails at the counter overlooking the tiny dinning room, what's the story?  Puts her purse on the stainless steel counter were some prepared food is placed, not very sanitary!\n",
      "Clueless on training the staff and how she or the staff respond to requests.\n",
      "We asked for the music to be turned down a little because at our table of 4, we had a hard time hearing each others conversation.  \n",
      "First request to waitress; who responded \" I don't think they will allow me to do that.\"  OK not the correct way to respond..maybe this should be worded differently!  \n",
      "Is the customer important or what!   \n",
      "The music was not turned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later the owner came by to say hello and check on things.\n",
      "Requested the music be turned down a bit.  Her response, \"We want to have some atmosphere.\"  Not the correct response, again!  Again, it was not turned down.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Mediterranean pizza is scrumptious and savory...garlic sauce, red onions, artichoke hearts, black olives, roasted peppers, tomatoes & feta.  What else could you ask for.\n",
      "Nice place, definitely nicer than the MSq, but I do like to watch the cooks at MSq.  Love the long bar and the beer selection.  If your into whiskey you are in luck. \n",

      "Concentrated on the burger, that is why you come isn't it?  No sides to distract!  \n",
      "They really know their beef!  \n",
      "A fresh ground great burger.  \n",
      "The I Don't Care. Whatever burger is so delicious with so many great flavors...love the pepper jack and bleu cheese sharpness to go with the jalapenos and pepperonicini.  So juicy and tasty!  \n",
      "Cooked perfectly.  \n",
      "Congrats to the kitchen!\n",
      "Just love little diners that serve good breakfast!  It is small and tables on top of each other but not to noisy and easy to talk.  All the tables on the little deck were in use so we picked a table inside. \n",
      "Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  \n",
      "There were a couple of specials to go with the usual breakfast menu and there are a few sandwiches or wraps, too.  Stopped by with a couple of friends because one loves the omelettes.   I had the Huevos Rancheros that has Chorizo, onion, tomato, with salsa on Nachos.  The waitress suggested a half order, and oh she was correct.  Very good sized half order. of mixed grill with lots of egg, pepper, onions, potatoes and sausage!  Yum!  Very good indeed.  The others enjoyed their omelette and French Toast. \n",

      "Also, pretty cool place with some memorabilia for Bobby Vinton and Perry Como.  Definitely not your normal McD's interior.\n",
      "We stopped in for a bite to eat looking for some pasta for take out.  The restaurant is small with about 6 or 7 tables, some for 2 or 3 and a couple for 4. It use to be another restaurant that we had been to once years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Found out it is BYOB for $5.  Yea!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the rigatoni with hot sausage and tomato sauce.  The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the hot sausage were very good.  I thought the tomato sauce was OK, could use a little more seasoning for my taste. Received some warm buttered bread with the meal.  We were talking to the owner and he grew up in the neighborhood and had a shop on the Northside but closed that and then found this space.\n",

      "The back of the checklist has salads, crisp wings with about 8 dipped and 5 rubbed flavors. \n",
      "\n",

      "Ok, where do you go with your college age kid on $1 sub day at JJ's.  JJ's of course.\n",
      "There was a line out the door but it moved fast.  The staff was well prepared and did an excellent job of getting the subs out. Had the Italian Club.  It was good, with plenty of meat including some capcola, ham, salami and provolone cheese.  Wanted hot peppers, but forgot to ask.  Thought the bun was a little lacking...have had better bread, but maybe it had to do with the early baking to have enough bread for the $1 sub day.\n",
      "We split a bag of chips that were very crunchy and more like kettle chips.\n",
      "Nice!  Really good tacos....made to order with all the toppings except the salsa.  The salsa comes in a squeeze bottle in mild, medium or hot.  Had the medium and it was standard medium; may try the hot next time.  Had the chorizo and carnitas Mexicano style.  These tacos are on par with Las Palmas and a couple of other taco stands in the area.  If you like real street tacos with fresh ingredients this is a good stop.\n",
      "There are a couple of tables and and awning cover them so you can eat at the table as everyone walks by on the sidewalk or take it with you.\n",
      "Hello! was the friendly greeting as we entered.  Here's how this works:  you pick up a menu as you walk in the door, you can order a salad or burger on the menu or create your own.  There are over 50 salad toppings.  So much to chose from!  The salad is huge!  My partner in eating ordered one of the specialty salads.  You then watch them mix the salad and cut/chop the mixed greens; your choice of small, medium or large chunks.  Then they add the dressing of your choice.  \n",
      "\n",

      "The place is very large, seat yourself when we were there, if you can find a table, and noisy.  Managed to get a table as we walked in that they were cleaning.  Others after us had to wait a few minutes.  Somehow our waitress knew we were there and waited on us quickly.  We had our drinks quickly and ordered two pizzas, a Margarita and the Wake & Bake which has bacon+sausage, banana pepper, fresh cracked egg, smoked provolone, mozzarella and basil.  The Margarita was pretty good, thought the sauce was a tad bitter but OK.  The pizza dough was good, a good blend of crisp and chew, a nice flavor.   Only wish they had some olive oil to dip the crust in.  The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and was good but nothing special but I would like to come back and try some other items and pizza. \n",

      "If your looking for something fresh - a salad, sandwich or a good soup, IO Deli has it.  Small sliver of a store that is take-out or you can stand.  There were four soups where you help yourself, or order a sandwich or salad.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Had a cup of the Tomato bisque soup.  IO makes some great soups and I was not disappointed.  The Portabella Panini with fresh spinach, caramelized onion, roasted peppers and munster cheese was delightful.  Had a side order of kale slaw that was very taste, it had a sharp taste that is perfect for a slaw.  \n",

      "You know they must smoke the meat when you walk in, it has the smoked flavor in the air.\n",
      "The rib taco with pickles, onions and a BBZ sauce taco and the pork taco with apricot habaneros sauce were very good.  \n",
      "The menu has expanded since my last visit at the Homestead location, but did not try any of the sides.\n",
      "Stopped in to give it a try.  Sat in the bar area.  \n",

      "Service was good but our meal took longer than you would expect. Did not time it, but was more like a fancy restaurant.\n",
      "Had the Shrimp tacos that have chipotle mayo and some sort of dressing with Napa cabbage, red onions and supposedly cilantro. It come with an avocado cream sauce, fire roasted tomato sals and tortilla chips.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, warm and tender but there was little taste to the sauce or the taco.  Was looking for some of the cilantro flavor and it was none existent.  The tortilla chips were pretty good but was not a fan of the fire-roasted tomato salsa since it just tasted like smoke.  The avocado cream was OK but I wish it had a little richer avocado flavor.  \n",
      "My associate had the Jambalaya and said it was very good and something he had on a previous visit.\n",
      "Surprised to see so many tables and a nice casual restaurant, was expecting more of a take out place.  The floors are a nice sealed cement and the walls have some nice wood wainscot. The place was crowded at lunch time. We had a large piece of pizza, mine with pepperoni, the other with sausage.  The sausage is a sliced sausage, not crumbled as most pizza parlors.  However, the sausage was pretty none disrupt, not much flavor just lacking that Italian sausage flavor. The pepperoni was good.  The crust is what I call a medium thickness and cooked perfectly.  A pretty good piece of pizza.\n",
      "Litte shop in a small semi-deserted strip mall.   Nice indoor seating with a TV.  The pepperoni pizza we ordered had a off taste.  The sauce was plain and not one anyone seemed to really enjoy.\n",
      "NIce little Mexican restaurant.  \n",
      "Seats about 20.\n",
      "Nice selection of some traditional Mexican food.  \n",
      "Selected the lunch special. The Sopa de Verdure (Veggie soup) is not your mothers veggie soup, due to the cilantro.  It was tasty with lots of veggies.  The agua fresca horchata was very refreshing. The empanada and enchilada were good but the endhilada was on the cold side.\n",
      "Nice little place for a quick and inexpensive meal.  Have had the Fish & Chips and decided to try the Banger & Chips on this visit.  The Banger and Chips were good.  Received a little cup of gravey to go with the sausage.  The Chips are really good, too.  \n",
      "The staff is super friendly.\n",
      "There is one communal table that seats about 9 and a counter in the window that seats about 4. So not a place to eat in if you are with a large group.\n",

      "\n",
      "Flatbread style pizza with homemade flatbread.  Many sandwiches on the menu, too.  There are many different types of specialty pizza including 5 or 6 vegetarian pizzas, a pierogi pizza, Smoked Baby Back Rib pizza and pizza deserts.  Someone waiting said some of the desert pizzas are really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just had a regular pizza and it was good.  The flatbread crust was good, thick and crunchy.\n",

      "Nice and spicy, but not to much, some sweetness too. \n",
      "Well we finished with no room for desert and easily made or deadline!\n",
      "Called in and ordered take out.  Was told 10 to 15 minutes.  So when I got there in 10 minutes they were preparing our order.  The front looks into a kitchen area and there was confusion.  A few other take outs and many servers standing around trying to get the orders straight.  No real system so once you get your order they then take 10 minutes to ring up your order.  This happened to a few other take out orders in front of me.  The kitchen staff seemed confused on what containers to put the food in and transferred a few?  \n",
      "As to the food had the chips and salsa which were good and some tacos.  The salsa is a little more liquid than I like has fresh cilantro and enjoyable.  Had a Bisteck ala Mexicana taco..the beef was overcooked and it was OK, and a Carnitas taco that was OK.\n",
      "Good Crust.\n",
      "Crisp and chewy crust with garlic butter and parmigiana cheese sprinkled on the edges.\n",

      "It was crowded and a little noisy.  The parking lot for the shopping center (Bill Green) was pretty full with Atria's and the other stores clientele.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is typical Atria's.  The Sherry Crab Bisque was OK...a little to cheesy.  Have found the pasta's are pretty good and ordered the Nonna's Sunday pasta, which has some sausage and slow cooked beef.  Very tasty, the brisket really added some nice flavors to go along with the sausage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our waitress had trouble answering a few questions but a waiter helped out and said the Nonna's pasta was his fav.  Service was pretty good and the meal came out before some other tables that were seated before ours, maybe they ordered after us.\n",
      "Hey! You wanna meatball?  Good meatballs and pizza.  This use to be Franco's Pizzeria Italiana but the owner changed the name to his name but still has the same good food.  Stopped by and had a meatball and small pizza.  good taste and good cheese on the pizza.\n",

Only two chairs and not much room to put a table if they decide to except in the window box.They have the usual pizza, wings, burgers, Shawarma & gyro, salads and oven baked sandwiches.\n",
      "Had a pizza and the crust was soft and chewy and the sauce a little on the sweet side.\n",
      "OK, we wondered thru the Grocery, which looked nice and had some interesting items, to get to the Market Street Wine Shop and Wine Bar.  The Wine Bar probably should have its own listing on Yelp. \n",
      "The wine bar carries Collefrisio wines from Italy. You can order a glass, a bottle, a flight, or take a bottle home with you.  Unfortunately not all wines or cheeses were available.  We selected two different reds to try and compare. Both were a dark ruby red with some fruity scent one had a more cherry jam flavor and the other more of a black cherry and mulberry flavor and were pretty well balanced. \n",
      "We decided to try some cheese and meat options/charcuterie with our wine.  As mentioned previously, they were out of one of the cheeses and one of the meat options. We had a Jasper Hill cheddar cheese that was very good and a goat cheese that went well with the wines.  The soppressata was good but cut very thin, just a tad to thin.  It came with some slices of bread and mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitstaff was very nice and helpful but the service was a bit disjointed.  It was a full house and a small place with only about 12 seats.  \n",

Had the Korean fried chicken that comes with a delicious Bao bun and some good house pickles.  The chicken was tender, moist and very good. There are 5 sauces to pick from and some sides n' sweets.  The Kim Chi side was very good.  Can't wait to come back and try the empanadas.\n",
      "The place was busy.  There are a lot of tall tables for 4 or they can be changed to two.  When we arrived all were in use.  After we ordered at the counter, a table opened up.  \n",

      "Stopped by Bad Azz stand at the Rib Fest at Heinz Field.  Most of the different rib stands were busy and so was Bad Azz.  Their line was one of the longer and It took about 30 minutes to get our order in but we received our order in just a few minutes.   Ordered ribs plus beans and Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were cooked perfectly..tender and tasty and moist.  The sauce is a tomato based smokey sweet with some spiciness, really a winner.  The Mac & Cheese was good with a little sharper cheese than most places and the noodles were the usual overcooked/soft that you get at BBQ places.  The  beans were very tasty with a touch of spiciness.\n",
      "Stopped by for lunch.  Service was fast and good. The Manager stopped by to talk and see how everything was.  Nice atmosphere.  Basically one large room with a bar off to the side.  Had the Ricotta Gnocchi that has short rib and calabrian chili.  Very tasty with some spice.  Really a good stop for lunch.\n",

      "Stopped in for lunch.  Was thinking pizza but noticed the great deal on 1/2 Italian hoagie, chips and 20 oz drink for $4.99.  Sold!  The hoagie is good, not as good as my fave place but good.  Service was friendly and fast.\n",

      "The sign says, \"Rub, Smoke, Love\".  Smoq uses four different woods to smoke the meat and you will know it is smoked by the smoke smell in the restaurant and that it clings to your cloths when you leave. The ribs were nice with a smoke flavor and juicy, so better than most over cooked ribs in the area.  The meat was tender and tasty.  Three sauces were on the table.  A sweet that others liked but I thought to sweet and not a good compliment to the meat.  The Tangy was pretty good with a hint of mustard but not overpowering like most South Carolina sauces, and the spicy which was OK.  Tried the mac and cheese side and it was very good with a nice harder cheddar flavor.  Will have to come back and try some of the other items.\n",

      "The Simple Greek, as has been written by others is nice, like a Chipotle for Greek, pick what you want and make a gyro or rice bowl with pita, you just pick your protein or veggie and then the toppings...It is fast and simple.\n",
      "I had a make your own gyro which was fun to create and good to eat.  Had a side of Greek fries.  They slice the potato behind the counter and add spice and feta cheese.  Really good fries.\n",

      "Really enjoyed my meal.  As I have reviewed there is now a restaurant next door that is similar and Aladdin across the street.  Not sure why the new restaurant moved in next door when the food is almost the same.  Stop by and enjoy a good meal at a fair price.\n",
      "Felt like I was in a time warp.  Everyone new each others name.  Stopped by for a quick beer, sandwich and some wings.  Many customers know each other and were very friendly.  So was the staff.  Ran into someone I work with.  Holy Cow!  Wings were pretty good. Had a sausage hoagie and it was good.  Beer is pretty cheap.   Daily specials on food and beer.\n",
      "The Yard at the Galleria recently opened.   The menu seems to be the same as the other locations.  There are about 40 beers on tap.  About 20 TV's above the bar and a few around the large open space in the top floor.  The arched walls/ceiling are black but with the large window and opening to the remainder of the Galleria, so it is very open.  The menu has some interesting combinations for cheese, meat, chicken, turkey or veggie with some interesting toppings.  My Dr. Dobak sandwich come on Texas toast thick bread with both provolone and cheddar cheese with a large amount of Short Rib, an Onion Rigs and Strawberry onion jam.  I really enjoyed my sandwich and the short rib but the strawberry jam made it a little sweeter than I expected.  The tomato soup that came with was good and the homemade potato chips are perfect.\n",
      "Good tacos.  Watched as he heated the tortilla and made the tacos.  Had a barbacao and el pastor.  Both were good.  He asked if we wanted cilantro or chipotle cream on top.  The truck as burritos and tortas too.\n",
      "Stopped by for lunch.  Have driven by hundreds of times and ended up there because a friend said to met him at Dukes Station.  The bar and dining area were bright and very nice.  The waitress was very friendly and quick to seat us.  Service was very good.  My friend had the ribs and shared one with me, it was cooked perfectly so it was ready to come of the bone and the sauce was a nice sweet and tangy combo.  Had a pork sandwich that was very good with a nice sauce that also was sweet and tangy but not to sweet.  French fries came with the sandwich and were very good. Must have liked the fries, because kept eating them ever after I though I had finished.\n",

      "Taco Tuesday, so stopped in for a couple of Tacos.  Ordered the Carnitas and Chorizo tacos.  The tacos were good, the meat tasty and some fresh cilantro on top.  The price is $3.25 which seems high as compared to Las Palmas or Edgars or Sabroso which all have a taco that is just as good or better.\n",
      "Stop by and say hello to Gary.  Very friendly service and tasty pizza.  This is in an old pizza shop that was not the best but the pizza is much better.  The menu has regular pizza pies and Northern Italian square cut, hoagies and salads.  The crust is thinner and has a nice crunch.  The sauce seems to line up with some the the more popular style pizza in the area.  Parking is limited and no tables.  A few chairs at the window.\n",
      "Stopped by to grab some pizza and some wings.  They said it was the Grand Opening week.  Enjoyed the \"Fresh Wings\".  Had the hot and would have liked to tried the Wing Dust based on their description.  The pizza crust was a medium thickness with a golden brown edge and bottom.  We had the Cigar Rolls which are filo (sp, their spelling) triangles filled with feta and some parsley that are deep fried.  A little on the greasy side, wish they were baked.\n",

The \"Frank \" was very good and enjoyed the toppings.  The menu also has a few salads, a few poutines and other sides.  We shared a Quebecoise Poutine that was OK, the fries were good but the gravy was a little cold and just not as good as I was expecting.\n",

Had been told to try the crab cakes, so I did and was not disappointed, crab cakes were very rich and moist with at tangy red onion caper sauce.  Did I mention the crab cakes were great.  Fresh veggies came with the meal that were nice and crisp...perfectly cooked.\n",

We had seven and all the tables and counters were taken and it did not look like any table was ready to leave so we shared a little table on the patio and were offered a few extra seats from a couple of other tables.\n",

The contrast in styles was wonderful.  The meat was tender and smoky tasting.  The tortilla's were good but did not add much flavor; wondering what it would be like on a corn tortilla.  We shared one side of some of the most delicious mac & cheese..yum to the sharp cheese flavor.  Some of the other sides sound very appetizing, will have to give them a try next time.\n",

The chicken wings are lightly breaded with some seasoning and were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside...very good.  The Shrimp was a little over breaded but still very good and tasty.  The fries are kind of what you get at this type of place..soft and OK.  The Okra was over breaded and just not very good.\n",

      "I had the Spicy Duck Noodles at level 5, which was just about right.  I like spicy food but want to taste the food too. The duck was tender and the noodles and sauce were very good. SWMBO had the pad thai with shrimp that was very good and not as much a fan of spicy chose level 4.  I managed to get a bite and the shrimp was good but the spice level was higher than 4 probably closer to 7.  \n",

      "Love the BYOB.  Had brick oven pizza's made in the back of the restaurant Food is fresh and hot.  Of course you need to like the brick oven style of pizza.  Sauce was not my favorite for some reason maybe to bitter?  Not sure?  and seemed to lack flavor.  Staff was nice.  Did not get to try the pasta. Salad and tiramisu were good.\n",
      "Cool temperature and cool truck.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  \n",
      "The taco special was very good.  Received three tacos and they had three different fillings, so I tried all three.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and tasty, the pork was even better and the chicken was good too.  The Cannoli bites were out of this world.  The little balls of funnel cake were so much better than you get at most of the food stands, wowser!\n",

      "Always fun to try a BBQ with some slow smoked meats.  Unfortunately, so many selections and not much time or hunger to try a Sampler with 2 or 3 meat combos...next time.  While Selma claims to be a Texas Barbecue, there are 6 homemade sauces you can put on your meal.  Of course most of the sauces are named for areas know for BBQ, ie: Carolina, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas.  Tried many of the sauces, while I tend to like mine spicier and not to sweet, most of the sauces were a little sweet.  The Hot Memphis style was more my style.  The Carolina reminded me of a sweet mustard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff at the counter was very patient and helpful with questions.  The Mac & Cheese is the most ordered side, I was told.  So I had to give it a try.  The Mac & Cheese was nice and creamy.   For those who like veggies, there are collard greens and fried okra.  I tried the fried okra and it was pretty good.  Ordered the ribs and they were cooked to a fall off the bone tenderness, had a nice smoke taste but really were better with the sauce.   The ribs have a dry rub and are cooked with Hickory wood that must help give it that smoke flavor.   A corn bread roll came with the ribs and it was OK, a little dry but was good with the ribs.  \n",

They seem to use expeditors to deliver food, so it came out hot.  My Cuban sandwich was good.  It had the usual pork, ham, cheese and tasty pickle.  Had the sweet potato fries as the side that were your standard but good sweet potato fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SkinnyLisious menu had some interesting choices.  The Shrimp taco looked good, and the person that ordered it, was not about to share.  They received a really nice vegetable salad that had a somewhat sweet flavored dressing that was really tasty.\n",

A large plate with a combination of shrimp, chicken and charbroiled steak with onions, tomatoes, red and green peppers, cilantro and more.  Served with rice and refried beans, guac, sals, tow small cheese quesadillas and four totillas.  Yum!  The food came out nice and hot, not to spicy but very flavorful, veggies were not overcooked (which seems to happen at many other restaurants), and the shrimp, chicken and steak were good. \n",

      "Very nice atmosphere.  Dark with some blue accent lighting.   Seems a little more upscale then some of the others, but that is probably just the lighting and because it is so new.  This restaurant is actually in the corner of the mall with an outside entrance next to Macy's, a little hard to find if you do not know where it is.  As the name says, there is a sushi bar, hibachi tables, some regular tables and a bar area.   \n",

The salad that come with the meal was the typical Japanese steakhouse salad, but it was prepared earlier and kept in the cooler, which can be OK, but the lettuce was to cold and almost frozen.   I thought the prices were just a little lower than some of the other Hibachi places.\n",

      "Started with the Jubilee Steak Tartare that had sunflower seeds, sprouts, pickled garlic and deviled egg dressing with a couple of great homemade potato chips sticking out of the top. I enjoyed the tartare but it seemed a little bland to me.  For the main course the Lamb shank was tender and one of the better lamb shanks I have had.  Was not hungry for desert but had some wonderful Millie's Sorbert.  Looking forward to returning to try some of the other items and desert to go along with a dessert drink.\n",
      "Had to try some of CD's broasted chicken.  Has been a few years since my last visit.   CD was Voted \"Best Chicken by City Paper\".  But CD is much more than chicken.  Good homemade soups, a deli with hoagies, salad, sandwiches, and I hear the pizza is pretty darn good!\n",

The menu has some interesting items but we decided to just have a burrito - I had the Carnitas.  It was not very good.  Did not have the flavor of Carnitas or taste like the Carnitas that use to come out of Casa Rasta. SWMBO had the Jamaican Jerk and it had big chunks of chicken and tasted like my pork burrito.\n",

The Korean with wagyu short rib, peanuts, napa cabbage and cilantro was OK.  The cilantro and seasoning gave it a nice flavor and a little heat but some of the short rib was over grilled/charred to a crisp. Unfortunately due to the over grilling some of the meat was tasteless and hard to eat. Will definitely go back some time to try some other items on the menu.  The price of the meal and drinks seems to follow a local trend, where probably a little pricey for what you get, but still overall a good meal and good place to enjoy the cuisine.\n",

      "Another Pamela's.  Type of place you love or it is just OK.  Had a group in for the Holiday's and though this would be good place to go.  I know Obama likes the pancakes which are thinner and like crepes, so I tried them.  Not my cup of tea.  But my cup of tea was good.   Also, tried a vegetable omelet, and veggies were still cool.  The Lyonnaise potatoes are good.  Place was crowded and had a line waiting for tables, then service was slow and had trouble getting the check.  \n",

      "Decor is art deco 1960 combination.\n",
      "Stop by and try Deluca's #2.  Yes, Deluca's has opened a new diner in Robinson.  Nice new clean space.  The same delicious food.  We got there just before you had to wait and the place is pretty large, so it is popular.  The mixed grill was delicious..selected the hot sausage, over easy egg and the Mancini's bread that comes with is Oh So Good!\n",

      "The have a Halloween special on pumpkin pancakes.\n",

      "Fresh and Hot!  Good wings with about a dozen different flavors.  Everything is made to order.  Was quoted, \"It will be 14 minutes till your order is ready\".  Fresh hand cut fries.  Homemade slaw or baked beans.  The fries and beans were good.  Did not try the slaw.  Tried the mild and the Louisiana rub wings  Both were good but enjoyed the Louisiana a little more.  You get a choice of Ranch, Blue Cheese or Honey Mustard as a dip.  Had the blue cheese and it is blue cheese in ranch dressing so it has the chive flavor; would have preferred it without the chive flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was super friendly and helpful.  Explained the menu and all the options.  They also clean the tables when you are done.\n",
      "Yes!!!!!!\n",

      "Great service!\n",
      "Great Food!\n",
      "Love the BYOB!!! ($5).\n",
      "First off, the service was very good.  We were not in a hurry and the server understood and came by every once in a while to check on us with very good timing.  We split a few items.  Started with the Hot & Sour soup that was very good.  Had a Spicy tuna roll that was just OK and a California roll that was good.  The Tempura Donburi was very good, but only one large shrimp.  One of our group had the Sashimi Donburi and was very happy.  Others had some other sushi and were very pleased.  All in all we had a good meal and a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "CASH ONLY!  Be prepared!!!!\n",
      "What's not to like?  Good Sandwiches and good soup and friendly people!  Have stopped in a couple more times and have had great sandwiches.  The Cuban is delicious, it had dijon, swiss, capital and pork on a baguette and came with a pickle.   Also, had the crab sandwich again because it is so good.  The side of home made potato said is terrific,  some small redskins, cheese, chive and small pieces of cured ham.  Now that is cooler I had the Clam Chowder on my last visit.  Very good soup.\n",
      "The RedWood is hard to beat for a good sandwich.\n",
      "Found out this is a smaller chain out of Virginia that was  started by two men from Jalisco.  Most of the staff seemed to be Mexican.  The bar will probably do well.   The Margarita's were good.  Mojitos on the drink menu along with beers and frozen drinks for those interested\n",
      "\n",
      "The chips were warm and good.  The salsa was spicy.  The enchiladas Nortenas consisted of three corn tortillas, a chicken topped with spinach sauce,  one with potato and chorizo topped with cheese sauce, a cochinita pibil.   All the enchiladas and the meats were good.  Really enjoyed the chorizo.  However, the cheese on top was not my favorite.  Tasted like some of the less expensive cheese from the ball park\n",
      "Nice place to grab a quick meal or watch a sporting event.  About 10 TV's in the bar area.  Had the soft taco special, that was good pub grub.  Service was very good and very friendly.\n",
      "Good fresh food and Belgian beer.  Moules, or mussels, are available and good portion.  Clean and very flavorful.  Had to have the frites, or fries, served Belgian style just like use to get in Belgian and other parts of Northern Europe, with mayo and some vinegar and some flavoring.  They are crispy and thin, most in Europe were fat and crisp.  Frites are wonderful. Crab cakes are delicious and so were some of the other dishes we tried.\n",
      "If your like the old Italian sandwich similar to Tootie's on the Southside or Old School in Homestead you are probably going to like Portogallo.  Good bread with some good Italian beef, but the the giardiniera makes the difference.  Good sauce with a little bit of heat but not to much served in a cup so you can decide how much to use.  Use it all, it is a large sandwich and the giardiniera is what makes it so good.  You can buy the giadiniera in bottles/jar to take home along with some local t-shirts.  \n",
      "Will have to come back and try the Italian taco.  \n",
      "Service was friendly, we were so busy talking that I forgot to take a picture of my sandwich.\n",
      "The shop is small with just a few tables and about six seats at a counter.\n",
      "V3 is like a few other pizza shops that are around that you order and have it built and cooked as you are in line - City Oven, Stone and many in other cities.  \n",
      "Owned by Vocelli's.\n",
      "You can order from 3 crusts and 5 sauces, lots of toppings and after it is cooked they put an oil at the end if you would like.  You can pick what you want and there are about 8 pizzas on the menu.  I ordered the Sunny Side Sausage and had sun fried tomato added.  All for $8.  Not bad.  The pizza was good but the dough was a little dry and not any flavor.  There are two salads on the menu. \n",
      "The place is small with a few tables but the line was beside the few tables, more of a take out place.  \n",
      "I would think that this will be popular for lunch in a busy downtown.\n",
      "Wing night!  AS everyone has already written, Monday thru Thursday $.35.  Have to get 10.  The wings are crisp and tasty.  $3 drafts.  Spent $7.   Service was good and friendly.  This is really a dive bar but a fun place for wings, a draft and a good place to watch some sports on all the TV's.\n",
      "The chicken sandwich with chile honey & rutabaga slaw was tasty with some sweetness. Chicken was very good..Chef said it was free range & came from a local farm..forget the name.\n",
      "Place was packed.  Hard to get a seat.  If it is you first time, it may take a little time to pick the sub you want to devour.  The Godfather is good, and you can customize your sub with toppings.  Good chocolate chip cookies, too.\n",
      "Really nice Brunch.   There was a line but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was terrific.  She stopped by with the specials to show us what was available.  Very attentive and helpful.  W had the Brunch that included a cream filled crepe with berry puree, eggs provencale, and beautiful croissant.  We did have to ask for the berry puree because the kitchen forgot to put it on the plate and it was oh so good!  \n",
      "\n",
      "The duck confit was melt in you mouth tasty!\n",
      "Another nice little restaurant on the BLVD.  Jolina's is a little place with about 8 tables, some tables only for 2 or 3.  Service was good and friendly.  Had the lunch special of a sandwich, fries and drink for $10.  How can you beat that price?  The chicken shawarma was OK, the chicken was a little dry.  Nice to have another good option on the BLVD.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did say it is BYOB.\n",
      "Have heard many good things about BM.  Have stopped at Lucy's outside many times for lunch.  Finally had the opportunity to dine at BM.  Nice little dining area with a very friendly and active staff. The bar staff can make a good cocktail.  A nicely designed wine list. Started with the Pork Tonnato that has a white tuna caper aioli.  A delicious start.  For my main course I had the Chestnut Fettuccine that had wild boar argue and parmigiano. A very good meal that was well prepared.  \n",
      "The staff is said a living wage salary so it is reflected in the prices; and the prices are very fair.\n",
      "OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.\n",
      "Nice place that reminds me of some of the little seafood shacks that are along the east coast just a little fancier and no holes in the table for shucking.  There are a bunch of picnic tables outside.  The second floor bar has some rocking chairs.  Started with the Rhode Island Red chowder.  Very tasty chowder.  My Lobster Roll with old bay brown butter and some other herbs was good.  The roll came with some home made old bay chips which were very crisp and tasty.  \n",
      "I did peruse the oyster selection but was more interested in the chowder and roll.  As others have said the oysters seem to be a bit pricey. \n",
      "We asked for ice tea but there is not any available.  So get a beer.  If you want utensils or straws they are in a little fry bucket on the table or bar including straws that were not covered and some aluminum straws.  My other half was not real fond of this since others could put their fingers on them while taking one.  But they do seem to be trying to be like some of the seafood shacks along the coast.\n",
      "Stopped by after picking up a friend at the airport who had not eaten in hours, no dinner due to long flight, and it was late.  We were eating our hand-crafted, cylinder of Mexican wonderfulness in a few minutes.  Chipotle is good tasting Mexican fast food, with natural and organic ingredients.  The Flour tortilla with cilantro lime rice, pinto bean and carnitas was very good.\n",
      "Good fresh burger.  Ordered a build your own with applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese, haystack onions.  The burger was good and enjoyed the toppings.  Liked the haystack onions.  Had a delicious creamy Strawberry shake and some Smashfries that have olive oil, rosemary & garlic.  The fries are shoestring and OK, would have preferred fatter fries.   It is a little more expensive than regular burger fast food places but you get a big burger and good quality.\n",
      "Stopped in to try the burgers.  You won't be disappointed.  The burger is thick and tasty.  Cooked perfectly.  The burgers are thick so it does take about 15 minutes to cook, so don't expect McD's yawl.  Had the Blues Burger which includes bacon, a great combination with tasty bacon, blue cheese and great burger.  We also ordered some Cajun wings.  The wings had a crispy skin but lacked flavor,  needed more Cajun dust.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, Applewood is in the back of Park Place Pub so you can get a beer from the Pub.  There is seating outside on some tables in the lot and patio in the back.\n",
      "Little, 3 tables and 5 or 6 seats at counter.  BYOB but crowded.  Food is made to order and made by women named Yong.  She is very friendly and funny. Talked to her while she cooked.  Food was amazing.  Spicy, tried the Korean kimchi pancakes and Bulgogi.  In Cecil a few miles off of I79. Korean cole slaw was crispy and spicy.  Has take out.\n",
      "If your looking for a slice this place is nice.  You get a piece that takes two plates.  The pizza was good.  The dough was pretty good but my piece probably needed a couple more minutes in the oven.  It is a thinner crust but puffy on the edge. The dough had a nice taste but a little under done.\n",
      "Crisp wings and tender inside.  About 25 regular flavors and about 50 Signature flavors, some of which are a combination of regular flavors.  Really hard to decide what flavor to get so take a few friends so you an share and get to try different flavors.  Was able to have the Beaver Falls which is tangy and hot, was told it is one of the favorites, and I can see why.  Also, had the chance to try Jamaician Jerk which were OK, but not as good as I was expecting.  Will have to stop back and try some of the others.   Wings were 6 for $4.99 or 13 for $9.25, also had a 50 wings for approx $30 (I guess U better be hungry, lol).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash Only!!!!!!\n",
      "Busy place at lunch time.  Interesting long narrow place with a long bar with windows that open up into a outdoor type of place that is covered & walled by that old ripple fiberglass and has some space heaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nice list of beers on a chalkboard.  Also a small chalkboard with daily specials and soup of the day. Was interested in some of the appetizers but not real hungry...probably should have gotten a couple of appetizers instead I ordered the Bacon Turkey Swiss on a croissant with lettuce and tomato. The sandwich that comes with a choice of fresh cut fries or power slaw.  The sandwich and fries were good.  \n",
      "Service was fast and friendly.\n"
