A gyro with thick, tender, tasty, spicy and juicy meat, with that zingy creamy cuke sauce.  Instead, I got this.  First, the weight was way too light.  Skimpy, taste-free meat with too-thin sauce, wrapped in softened cardboard.  I gave it a shot, I really did, but it was SO not worth the price.","date":"2013-08-20","likes":0,"business_id":"aeomionBr_VTsIg119vtSw","user_id":"nlKFcgvZm_KYTjZXUF-d0g"}

{"text":"No doubt Kennywood as a whole is a dream for Pittsburghers. The only complaint is the garbage food choices and the excessive pricing for the low quality. One change during 2013 was the chicken strips sold at Small Fry. Until this year they were natural strips of chicken breast meat. Now, they switched to processed, preforrmed nuggets. Thanks!

{"text":"Avoid the shopping center on Steeler Sundays, holidays, and the 4th of July. It is a legit madhouse. People are cutthroat crazy around these times in an already tight parking lot! The 4th of July is an interesting time for this area. They have a parade and if you drive down Brownsville road a few days prior to the 4th , you can see all the chairs people set out to reserve their spot for the parade. I would definitely steer clear of this shopping center a few days before and the day of the 4th.","date":"2014-09-20","likes":0,"business_id":"qC7ATMm1D0Y0-G2dxwMYmw","user_id":"l3ryB3Q6WZ3uHDHVe2HgoA"}
